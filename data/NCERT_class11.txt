WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY?
---Data---
Any knowledge discipline is hard to define. Firstly, because it evolves continuously. Secondly, because the range of phenomena it studies cannot be captured by any one definition. This is even more true of psychology. Long time back, students like yourself were told that the term psychology is derived from two Greek words psyche meaning soul and logos meaning science or study of a subject. Thus, psychology was a study of the soul or mind. But since then it has moved away considerably from this focus and established itself as a scientific discipline which deals with processes underlying human experience and behaviour. The range of phenomena it studies, some of which we mentioned above, are spread over several levels, viz. individual, dyadic (two person) group, and organisational. They also have biological as well as social bases. Naturally, therefore, the methods required to study them also vary greatly depending on the phenomenon one wants to study. A discipline is defined both in terms of what it studies and how it studies. In fact, more in terms of how or method/s it uses. Keeping this in view, psychology is defined formally as a science which studies mental processes, experiences and behaviour in different contexts. In doing so, it uses methods of biological and social sciences to obtain data systematically. It makes sense of these data so that they can be organised as knowledge. Let us try to understand the three terms used in the definition, namely, mental processes, experience, and behaviour.

---Title---
What is mental process?
---Data---
When we say experiences are internal to the experiencing person, then we refer to states of consciousness or awareness or mental processes. We use our mental processes when we think or try to solve a problem, to know or remember something. One level at which these mental processes are reflected is the brain activity. As we think or solve a mathematical problem, our brain activities can be observed using different techniques of brain imaging. However, we cannot say that brain activities and mental processes are the same, although they are interdependent. Mental activities and neural activities are mutually overlapping processes but, they are not identical. Unlike the brain, the mind does not have a physical structure or has a location. Mind emerges and evolves as our interactions and experiences in this world get dynamically organised in the form of a system which is responsible for the occurrence of various mental processes. Brain activities provide important clues as to how our mind functions. But the consciousness of our own experiences and mental processes are much more than the neural or brain activities. Even when we are asleep some mental activities go on. We dream, and receive some information such as a knock on the door while we are asleep. Some psychologists have shown that we also learn and remember in our sleep. Mental processes, such as remembering, learning, knowing, perceiving, feeling are of interest to psychologists. They study these processes to try to understand how the mind works and to help us improve the uses and applications of these mental capacities.

---Title---
What are experiences?
---Data---
Psychologists also study experiences of people. Experiences are subjective in nature. We cannot directly observe or know someone else’s experience. Only the experiencing person can be aware or be conscious of her or his experiences. Thus, experiences are embedded in our awareness or consciousness. Psychologists have focused on experiences of pain being experienced by terminally ill patients or of psychological pain felt in bereavement, besides experiences which lead to positive feelings, such as in romantic encounters. There are some esoteric experiences also which attract the attention of psychologists, such as when a Yogi meditates to enter a different level of consciousness and creates a new kind of experience or when a drug addict takes a particular kind of drug to get a high, even though such drugs are extremely harmful. Experiences are influenced by internal and the external conditions of the experiencer. If you are travelling in a crowded bus during a hot summer day, you may not experience the usual discomfort if you are going for a picnic with some close friends. Thus, the nature of experience can only be understood by analysing a complex set of internal and external conditions.

---Title---
What is behaviour?
---Data---
Behaviours are responses or reactions we make or activities we engage in. When something is hurled at you, your eyes blink in a simple reflex action. You are taking an examination and can feel your heart pounding. You decide to go for a particular movie with a friend. Behaviours may be simple or complex, short or enduring. Some behaviours are overt. They can be outwardly seen or sensed by an observer. Some are internal or covert. When you are in a difficult situation while playing a game of chess you almost feel your hand muscles twitching, trying to experiment with a move. All behaviours, covert or overt, are associated with or triggered by some stimulus in the environment or changes that happen internally.

---Title---
Psychology as a Discipline
---Data---
As we have discussed above, psychology studies behaviour, experience and mental processes. It seeks to understand and explain how the mind works and how different mental processes result in different behaviours. When we observe others as lay or common persons, our own points of view or our ways of understanding the world influence our interpretations of their behaviours and experiences. Psychologists try to minimise such biases in their explanations of behaviour and experience in various ways. Some do so by seeking to make their analysis scientific and objective. Others seek to explain behaviour from the point of view of the experiencing persons because they think that subjectivity is a necessary aspect of human experience. In the Indian tradition, self-reflection and analysis of our conscious experiences, is held to be a major source of psychological understanding. Many western psychologists have also begun to emphasise the role of self-reflection and self-knowledge in understanding human behaviour and experience. Regardless of the differences in the way psychologists go about the study of behaviour, mental processes and experiences, they seek to understand and explain them in a systematic and verifiable manner.
Psychology, though it is a very old knowledge discipline, is a young science, if one were to take the year of the founding of the first laboratory of psychology in 1879 in Leipzig. However, what kind of science is psychology, still remains a matter of debate, particularly because of the new interfaces of it that have emerged in recent times. Psychology is generally categorised as a social science. But it should not come to you as a surprise that, not only in other countries, but in India also, it is also a subject of study offered in the faculty of science, both at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels. Many students go on to earn a B.Sc. or M.Sc. degree in universities. In fact, two of the most sought after emerging disciplines which continuously borrow from psychology are Neuroscience and Computer Science. Some of us would be aware of the fast developing brain imaging techniques like fMRI, EEG, etc. which make it possible to study brain processes in real time, i.e. when they are actually taking place. Similarly, in IT areas, both human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence cannot possibly grow without psychological knowledge in cognitive processes.
Thus, psychology as a discipline today has two parallel streams. One which makes use of the method in physical and biological sciences and the other which makes use of the method of social and cultural sciences in studying various psychological and social phenomena. These streams sometimes converge only to drift apart and go their separate ways. In the first case, psychology considers itself as a discipline, which focuses largely on biological principles to explain human behaviour. It assumes that all behavioural phenomena have causes which can be discovered if we can collect data systematically under controlled conditions. Here the aim of the researcher is to know the cause and effect relationship so that a prediction of the behavioural phenomenon can be made and behaviour can be controlled if need be. On the other hand, psychology as a social science focuses on how behavioural phenomena can be explained in terms of the interaction that takes place between the person and the sociocultural context of which s/he is a part.

---Title---
Psychology as a Natural Science
---Data---
It has been mentioned earlier that psychology has its roots in philosophy. However, modern psychology has developed because of the application of the scientific method to study psychological phenomenon. Science places a great deal of emphasis on objectivity which can be obtained if there is consensus on the definition of a concept and how it can be Psychology was influenced by Descartes and later on by the developments in physics has grown by following what is called a hypothetico-deductive model. The model suggests that scientific advancement can take place if you have a theory to explain a phenomenon. For example, physicists have what is called a Big-bang theory to explain how the universe came to be formed. Theory is nothing else but a set of statements about how a certain complex phenomenon can be explained with the help of propositions which are interrelated. Based on a theory, scientists deduce or propose a hypothesis, that offers a tentative explanation of how a certain phenomenon takes place. The hypothesis then is tested and proved true or false based on empirical data that one has gathered. The theory is revised if data gathered point in a different direction than the one suggested by the hypothesis. Using the above approach psychologists have developed theories of learning, memory, attention, perception, motivation and emotion, etc. and have made significant progress. Till date, most of the research in psychology follows this approach. Apart from this, psychologists have also been considerably influenced by the evolutionary approach which is dominant in biological sciences. This approach has also been used to explain diverse kinds of psychological phenomenon such as attachment and aggression to mention just a few.

---Title---
Psychology as a Social Science
---Data---
We mentioned above that psychology is recognised more as a social science because it studies the behaviour of human beings in their socio-cultural contexts. Humans are not only influenced by their socio-cultural contexts, they also create them. Psychology as a social science discipline focuses on humans as social beings. Consider the following story of Ranjita and Shabnam. Ranjita and Shabnam were in the same class. Although, they were in the same class, they were just acquainted with each other and their lives were quite different. Ranjita came from a farmer’s family. Her grandparents, parents and elder brother worked on their farm. They lived together in their house in the village. Ranjita was a good athlete and was the best long-distance runner in the school. She loved meeting people and making friends. Unlike her, Shabnam lived with her mother in the same village. Her father worked in an office in a town nearby and came home during holidays. Shabnam was a good artist and loved staying home and taking care of her younger brother. She was shy and avoided meeting people. Last year there was very heavy rain and the river nearby overflowed into the village. Many houses in the low-lying areas were flooded. The villagers got together and organised help and gave shelter to people in distress. Shabnam’s house was also flooded and she came to live in Ranjita’s house with her mother and brother. Ranjita was happy helping the family and making them feel comfortable in her house. When the flood water receded, Ranjita’s mother and grandmother helped Shabnam’s mother to set up their house. The two families became very close. Ranjita and Shabnam also became very good friends. In this case of Ranjita and Shabnam, both are very different persons. They grew up in different families under complex social and cultural conditions. You can see some regularity in the relationship of their nature, experience and mental processes with their social and physical environment. But at the same time, there are variations in their behaviours and experiences which would be difficult to predict using the known psychological principles. One can understand why and how individuals in communities become quite helpful and self-sacrificing in crisis as was the case with the people in the village of Ranjita and Shabnam. But, even in that case, not every villager was equally helpful and also under similar circumstances not every community is so forthcoming; in fact, sometimes, the opposite is true – people become antisocial under similar circumstances indulging in looting and exploitation when some crisis occurs. This shows that psychology deals with human behaviour and experience in the context of their society and culture. Thus, psychology is a social science with focus on the individuals and communities in relation to their sociocultural and physical environment.

Understanding mind and behaviour
---Data---
You will recall that psychology was once defined as a science of the mind. For many decades, the mind remained a taboo in psychology because it could not be defined in concrete behavioural terms or its location could not be indicated. If the term “mind” has returned to psychology, we should thank neuroscientists like Sperry and physicists like Penrose, who have given it the respect which it deserved and now has. There are scientists in various disciplines including psychology, who think that a unified theory of the mind is a possibility, although it still is far away. What is mind? Is it the same as brain? It is true that mind cannot exist without brain, but mind is a separate entity. This can be appreciated on account of several interesting cases that have been documented. Some patients whose occipital lobes, which are responsible for vision, were surgically removed have been found to be responding correctly to location and configuration of visual cues. Similarly, an amateur athlete lost his arm in a motorcycle accident but continued to feel an “arm” and also continued to feel its movements. When offered coffee, his “phantom arm” reached out to the coffee cup and when someone pulled it away, he protested. There are other similar cases documented by neuroscientists. A young man who suffered brain injury in an accident, after he returned home from the hospital, claimed that his parents had been replaced by their “duplicates”. They were imposters. In each of these cases, the person had suffered from damage of some part of the brain but his “mind” had remained intact. It was earlier believed by scientists that there is no relationship between the mind and the body and that they were parallel to each other. Recent studies in affective neuroscience have clearly shown that there is a relationship between mind and behaviour. It has been shown that using positive visualisation techniques and feeling positive emotions, one can bring about significant changes in bodily processes. Ornish has shown this in a number of studies with his patients. In these studies a person with blocked arteries was made to visualise that blood was flowing through her/his blocked arteries. After practicing this over a period of time, significant relief was obtained by these patients as the degree of blockage became significantly less. Use of mental imagery, i.e. images generated by a person in her/his mind, have been used to cure various kinds of phobias (irrational fears of objects and situations). A new discipline called Psychoneuroimmunology has emerged which emphasises the role played by the mind in strengthening the immune system.

Popular notions about the discipline of psychology
---Data---
The text explains that in everyday life, people often act like psychologists by interpreting others' behavior and forming personal theories about human actions. However, these common-sense explanations are usually based on hindsight and may not hold true under scientific investigation. Psychology, as a science, seeks to identify patterns of behavior that can be predicted rather than explained after they occur. An example of scientific research challenging common beliefs is Dweck’s (1975) study on children who give up easily. Contrary to the belief that giving children easy tasks boosts confidence, Dweck found that children who faced a mix of easy and difficult problems were more resilient when encountering failure. The text also highlights other misconceptions, such as the belief that men are more intelligent than women or that performing before a large audience reduces performance—both of which have been disproven by psychological studies. The text emphasizes that psychology relies on systematic investigation and empirical evidence, distinguishing it from practices like astrology or palm reading. Readers are encouraged to question common-sense beliefs and adopt a more scientific approach to understanding human behavior.

---Title---
Origins and Early Development of Modern Psychology
---Data---
Modern psychology, although influenced significantly by Western developments, has its roots in ancient philosophy. Philosophers have long been concerned with questions related to human behavior and mental processes. The formal beginning of modern psychology is traced back to 1879, when Wilhelm Wundt established the first experimental psychology laboratory in Leipzig, Germany. This event marked the transition of psychology from a branch of philosophy to an independent scientific discipline. Wundt’s work laid the foundation for experimental methods in studying the human mind, emphasizing the importance of systematic observation and controlled experimentation.

---Title---
Structuralism and Introspection
---Data---
Wilhelm Wundt’s approach to psychology is known as structuralism, which aimed to analyze the structure or components of the mind. Structuralists believed that conscious experiences could be broken down into basic mental elements. To investigate these elements, Wundt and his followers relied on a method called introspection. In this process, subjects in psychological experiments were asked to describe their thoughts, feelings, and sensory experiences in detail. However, introspection faced significant criticism because it was subjective and lacked scientific reliability. Different observers often provided inconsistent reports, and the method did not allow for independent verification, leading to the development of alternative psychological approaches.

---Title---
Functionalism: The Study of Mental Functions
---Data---
Functionalism emerged as a reaction to structuralism and was developed by American psychologist William James. Unlike structuralists who focused on the composition of the mind, functionalists were interested in understanding how mental processes help individuals adapt to their environment. William James viewed consciousness as a continuous and dynamic stream rather than a collection of separate mental elements. This approach emphasized the practical functions of the mind and how behavior allows people to meet their needs. John Dewey, a prominent educational thinker, applied functionalist ideas to the field of education, arguing that human beings strive to adapt effectively to their surroundings. Functionalism broadened the scope of psychology by including the study of real-world behavior and its practical applications.

---Title---
Gestalt Psychology: Holistic Perception
---Data---
In the early 20th century, Gestalt psychology emerged in Germany as a response to the reductionist approach of structuralism. Gestalt psychologists argued that human perception is holistic and cannot be understood by analyzing individual components. According to this perspective, the whole of our perceptual experience is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, when we watch a movie, we perceive continuous motion, even though it is composed of a series of still images. Similarly, when light flashes rapidly, we experience it as moving light rather than individual flashes. Gestalt psychology highlighted the importance of understanding how people perceive and interpret patterns in their environment, a concept that remains influential in the study of perception and cognitive processes.

---Title---
Behaviorism: Focus on Observable Behavior
---Data---
Behaviorism, developed by John Watson around 1910, marked a significant departure from earlier approaches by rejecting the study of mental processes altogether. Influenced by Ivan Pavlov’s work on classical conditioning, Watson argued that psychology should focus only on observable and measurable behaviors. He defined psychology as the scientific study of behavior and responses to stimuli. According to behaviorists, internal mental states are irrelevant because they cannot be directly observed or objectively measured. B.F. Skinner further advanced behaviorism by applying its principles to various areas, including learning and reinforcement. Behaviorism dominated psychological research for several decades due to its emphasis on objectivity and scientific methodology, although it faced criticism for oversimplifying human experiences and ignoring cognitive processes.

---Title---
Psychoanalysis: The Unconscious Mind
---Data---
At the same time that behaviorism was gaining prominence, Sigmund Freud introduced a radically different perspective through psychoanalysis. Freud believed that human behavior is largely influenced by unconscious desires, thoughts, and conflicts. According to Freud, much of our mental life lies beneath the surface of conscious awareness and manifests itself in dreams, slips of the tongue, and neurotic behaviors. He developed psychoanalysis as both a theory and a therapeutic method for treating psychological disorders by uncovering and addressing unconscious conflicts. While Freud’s emphasis on sexuality and unconscious drives was controversial, his work had a profound impact on psychology and led to the development of psychodynamic theories.

---Title---
Humanistic Psychology: Free Will and Personal Growth
---Data---
Humanistic psychology emerged as a reaction to the deterministic views of behaviorism and the pessimistic outlook of psychoanalysis. Pioneers of this approach, such as Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, focused on the positive aspects of human nature, including free will, personal growth, and self-actualization. They argued that human beings have an innate drive to fulfill their potential and that psychological well-being depends on the realization of this potential. Humanistic psychologists criticized behaviorism for reducing human behavior to mechanical responses and argued that it neglected the subjective experience and personal meaning. This perspective introduced a more holistic view of human behavior and emphasized the importance of empathy, self-awareness, and individual choice.

---Title---
Diverse Approaches in Modern Psychology
---Data---
The history of modern psychology is characterized by the coexistence of multiple perspectives, each offering unique insights into human behavior and mental processes. Structuralism, functionalism, Gestalt psychology, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and humanistic psychology all contributed to the evolution of the discipline. Each approach has its own strengths and limitations, highlighting the complexity of psychological phenomena. Modern psychology continues to integrate these diverse perspectives, combining scientific rigor with an appreciation for the richness of human experiences. This multidisciplinary approach allows psychologists to explore and understand the vast range of human behavior and mental processes from various angles.

---Title---
The Rise of Cognitive Psychology and Constructivism
---Data---
Developments in psychology led to the emergence of the cognitive perspective, which focuses on understanding how humans acquire knowledge through mental processes like thinking, perceiving, memorizing, and problem-solving. Some cognitive psychologists compare the human mind to an information-processing system, similar to a computer that receives, processes, stores, and retrieves information. Modern cognitive psychology emphasizes that humans actively construct their minds through exploration of their physical and social environments—a view known as constructivism. Piaget’s theory of child development reflects this perspective, suggesting that children actively build their understanding through interaction with their surroundings. Vygotsky extended this idea by proposing that the mind is shaped through social and cultural processes, emphasizing the role of joint interactions between adults and children in mental development.

---Title---
Development of Psychology in India
---Data---
The Indian philosophical tradition deeply explores mental processes, consciousness, and mind-body relations. However, these philosophical roots have not significantly influenced modern psychology in India, which remains largely shaped by Western psychology. Some efforts have been made to validate Indian philosophical ideas through scientific studies. Modern psychology in India began in 1915 with the introduction of experimental psychology at Calcutta University, followed by the establishment of the Department of Psychology in 1916 and the Department of Applied Psychology in 1938. This development was led by Dr. N.N. Sengupta, who was trained in the experimental tradition of Wundt, and Professor G. Bose, who introduced Freudian psychoanalysis and founded the Indian Psychoanalytical Association in 1922. Other early centers for psychology included the Universities of Mysore and Patna. Today, psychology in India is a well-established discipline with over 70 universities offering courses and two UGC-supported centers of excellence at Utkal University and the University of Allahabad. Durganand Sinha, in his 1986 book *Psychology in a Third World Country: The Indian Experience*, outlined four phases of psychology’s development in India. The first phase (until independence) focused on experimental, psychoanalytic, and psychological testing, reflecting Western trends. The second phase (until the 1960s) marked an expansion into various branches while linking Western psychology to the Indian context. The third phase (post-1960s) emphasized problem-oriented research relevant to Indian society and recognized the limitations of relying on Western frameworks. The fourth phase (late 1970s onward) focused on indigenization, promoting psychological approaches rooted in India’s cultural and social context. This period also saw efforts to integrate insights from ancient Indian texts into psychological practices. Modern psychology in India is making substantial contributions to global psychology while developing principles grounded in the Indian social and cultural context. Research now extends to neurobiological and health sciences. Psychologists in India work across diverse fields, including clinical psychology in hospitals, human resources and advertising in corporate organizations, child psychology, sports psychology, and the development sector.

---Title---
Cognitive Psychology
---Data---
Cognitive Psychology investigates mental processes involved in acquisition, storage, manipulation, and transformation of information received from the environment along with its use and communication. The major cognitive processes are attention, perception, memory, reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language. In order to study these cognitive processes, psychologists conduct experiments in laboratory settings. Some of them also follow an ecological approach, which focuses on environmental factors to study cognitive processes in a natural setting. Cognitive psychologists often collaborate with neuroscientists and computer scientists.

---Title---
Biological Psychology
---Data---
Biological Psychology focuses on the relationship between behaviour and the physical system, including the brain, the nervous system, the immune system, and genetics. Biological psychologists often collaborate with neuroscientists, zoologists, and anthropologists.

---Title---
Neuropsychology
---Data---
Neuropsychology has emerged as a field of research where psychologists and neuroscientists work together. Researchers study the role of neurotransmitters or chemical substances responsible for neural communication in different areas of the brain and their associated mental functions. They conduct research on people with normal brain functioning as well as on those with damaged brains, using advanced technologies like EEG, PET, and fMRI.

---Title---
Developmental Psychology
---Data---
Developmental Psychology studies physical, social, and psychological changes that occur at different ages and stages over a lifespan, from conception to old age. While the major emphasis was on child and adolescent development, there is now growing interest in adult development and ageing. Developmental psychologists focus on biological, socio-cultural, and environmental factors that influence psychological characteristics such as intelligence, cognition, emotion, temperament, morality, and social relationships. They collaborate with anthropologists, educationists, neurologists, social workers, counsellors, and other professionals concerned with human growth and development.

---Title---
Social Psychology
---Data---
Social Psychology explores how people are affected by their social environments and how they think about and influence others. Social psychologists study topics such as attitudes, conformity, obedience to authority, interpersonal attraction, helpful behaviour, prejudice, aggression, social motivation, and inter-group relations.

---Title---
Cross-Cultural and Cultural Psychology
---Data---
Cross-Cultural and Cultural Psychology examines the role of culture in understanding behaviour, thought, and emotion. It assumes that human behaviour is not only a reflection of human-biological potential but also a product of culture. Therefore, behaviour should be studied in its socio-cultural context, as culture influences human behaviour in many ways and to varying degrees.

---Title---
Environmental Psychology
---Data---
Environmental Psychology studies the interaction of physical factors such as temperature, humidity, pollution, and natural disasters on human behaviour. It also investigates how physical arrangements of workplaces affect health, emotional states, and interpersonal relations. Current research topics include the impact of waste disposal, population explosion, energy conservation, and efficient use of community resources on human behaviour.

---Title---
Health Psychology
---Data---
Health Psychology focuses on the role of psychological factors, such as stress and anxiety, in the development, prevention, and treatment of illness. Areas of interest include stress and coping mechanisms, the relationship between psychological factors and health, patient-doctor relationships, and ways to promote health-enhancing behaviours.

---Title---
Clinical and Counselling Psychology
---Data---
Clinical and Counselling Psychology deals with the causes, treatment, and prevention of psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Counselling focuses on improving everyday functioning by helping people solve problems and cope with challenging situations. Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists both study psychological disorders, but a psychiatrist has a medical degree and can prescribe medications and perform medical treatments, whereas a clinical psychologist cannot.

---Title---
Industrial/Organisational Psychology
---Data---
Industrial/Organisational Psychology focuses on workplace behaviour, addressing both employees and the organisations that employ them. These psychologists are concerned with training employees, improving work conditions, and developing criteria for selecting employees. They may also suggest changes in management structures to improve communication and productivity.

---Title---
Educational Psychology
---Data---
Educational Psychology studies how people of all ages learn and focuses on developing instructional methods and materials for educational and workplace settings. A related field, school psychology, designs programs to promote intellectual, social, and emotional development, especially for children with special needs.

---Title---
Sports Psychology
---Data---
Sports Psychology applies psychological principles to improve sports performance by enhancing motivation. Although a relatively new field, sports psychology is gaining acceptance worldwide.

---Title---
Other Emerging Branches of Psychology
---Data---
Interdisciplinary research and application of psychology have led to the emergence of various new branches such as aviation psychology, space psychology, military psychology, forensic psychology, rural psychology, engineering psychology, managerial psychology, community psychology, psychology of women, and political psychology.

---Title---
PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER DISCIPLINES

---Data---
Any discipline, which deals with people, would definitely recognise the relevance of the knowledge of psychology. Similarly, psychologists also acknowledge the relevance of other disciplines in understanding human behaviour. This trend has led to the emergence of an interdisciplinary approach in the field of psychology. Researchers and scholars in science, social science and humanities have felt the significance of psychology as a discipline. In studying brain and behaviour, psychology shares its knowledge with neurology, physiology, biology, medicine and computer science. In studying human behaviour (its meaning, growth and development) in a socio-cultural context, psychology shares its knowledge with anthropology, sociology, social work, political science and economics. In studying mental activities involved in the creation of literary texts, music and drama, psychology shares its knowledge with literature, art and music.

---Title---
Philosophy

---Data---
Until the end of the 19th century, certain concerns that are now part of contemporary psychology like the nature of the mind or how humans come to know their motivations and emotions were the concerns of philosophers. In the later part of the 19th century, Wundt and other psychologists adopted an experimental approach to these questions, and contemporary psychology emerged. Despite the emergence of psychology as a science, it greatly draws from philosophy, particularly with respect to methods of knowing and various domains of human nature.

---Title---
Medicine

---Data---
Doctors have realised that the maxim, "a healthy body requires a healthy mind," is actually true. A large number of hospitals now employ psychologists. The role of psychologists in preventing people from engaging in health hazardous behaviours and in adhering to the prescribed doctors’ regimen are some of the important areas where the two disciplines have come together. While treating patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, and the physically challenged, or handling patients in the Intensive Care Unit and patients during post-operative care, doctors have also felt the need for psychological counselling. A successful doctor looks at the psychological as well as physical well-being of the patients.

---Title---
Economics, Political Science and Sociology

---Data---
As sister social science disciplines, these three have drawn considerably from psychology and have enriched it as well. Psychology has contributed a great deal to the study of micro-level economic behaviour, particularly in understanding consumer behaviour, savings behaviour, and decision-making. American economists have used data on consumer sentiments to predict economic growth. Scholars like H. Simon, D. Kahneman, and T. Schelling, who have worked on such problems, have received the Nobel Prize in Economics. Like economics, political science too draws considerably from psychology, particularly in understanding issues related to the exercise of power and authority, the nature of political conflicts and their resolutions, and voting behaviour. Sociology and psychology come together to explain and understand the behaviour of individuals within different socio-cultural contexts. Issues related to socialisation, group and collective behaviour, and intergroup conflicts gain from both these disciplines.

---Title---
Computer Science

---Data---
From the very beginning, the effort of computer science has been in mimicking the human mind. One can see it in terms of how a computer is structured, its memory organised, and its ability to perform sequential and simultaneous (parallel) processing of information. Computer scientists and engineers are seeking to make computers not only more intelligent but also machines that can sense and feel. Developments in both these disciplines have brought about significant advancements in the field of cognitive sciences.

---Title---
Law and Criminology

---Data---
A skilled lawyer and a criminologist require knowledge of psychology to answer questions such as: How well does a witness remember an accident, a street fight, or a murder? How accurately can they report such facts when taking the witness stand in court? What factors influence the decision taken by the jury? What are the dependable signs of guilt and falsehood? What factors are important in holding a culprit responsible for their actions? What degree of punishment is considered just for a criminal act? Psychologists seek to answer these questions. Currently, a number of psychologists are involved in research on such issues, and their findings could significantly aid the legal system in the future.

---Title---
Mass Communication

---Data---
The print and electronic media have entered our lives in a significant way, influencing our thinking, attitudes, and emotions. If they have brought us closer together, they have also reduced cultural diversities. The impact of media on the formation of children's attitudes and behaviours is an area where psychology and mass communication intersect. Psychology also helps in developing strategies for better and more effective communication. A journalist reporting news must understand the reader’s interests in the story. Since most stories deal with human events, knowledge of human motives and emotions is crucial. A story will have more impact if it is based on a background of psychological knowledge.

---Title---
Music and Fine Arts
---Data---
Music and psychology have converged in many areas. Scientists have made use of music in raising work performance. Music and emotions is another area in which a number of studies have been carried out. Musicians in India have recently started experimenting with what they call 'Music Therapy'. In this they use different 'Ragas' for curing certain physical ailments. The efficacy of music therapy still remains to be proven.

---Title---
Architecture and Engineering
---Data---
At first glance the relationship between psychology and architecture and engineering would appear improbable. But such is actually not the case. Ask any architect, s/he must satisfy her/his clients by providing mental and physical space through her design and satisfy aesthetically. Engineers must also take into account human habits in their plans for safety, for example, on streets and highways. Psychological knowledge helps in a big way in designing of all mechanical devices and displays.

---Title---
Psychology in Everyday Life
---Data---
Psychology is not just about understanding human nature—it also provides practical solutions to a wide range of personal and social problems. At the individual level, psychology helps people cope with personal challenges like family conflicts, stress, and decision-making. On a broader scale, psychological insights contribute to solving societal issues such as educational challenges, health crises, environmental concerns, and social justice. Media platforms frequently feature psychologists offering advice on child development, mental health, and social behavior. Psychologists are also actively involved in designing intervention programs aimed at improving the quality of life in diverse settings, including schools, hospitals, businesses, and the military. Additionally, psychology is personally relevant in daily life—it helps individuals develop effective study habits, improve memory, manage stress (such as during exams), and make better interpersonal decisions. A balanced understanding of oneself, free from defensive behavior or self-criticism, is essential for personal growth. Thus, psychology plays a crucial role in enhancing both individual well-being and societal progress.

---Title---
Meaning of Development
---Data---
When we think of development, we often associate it with physical changes, as these are the most visible in our daily lives. However, development encompasses much more—it involves changes in the way we think, use language, and engage in social relationships. This process begins at conception and continues throughout life, involving both growth and decline. Development is shaped by the interaction of biological, cognitive, and socio-emotional processes. Biological influences include genetic factors affecting height, weight, and organ development. Cognitive processes refer to mental activities like perception, thought, and problem-solving. Socio-emotional processes relate to changes in how individuals interact with others, experience emotions, and develop personality traits. These three dimensions are interconnected and jointly influence human development across the life span. Observing life from birth to old age reveals a continuous process of change, from learning basic skills like walking and talking to navigating complex social relationships and moral decisions. Understanding development helps us better comprehend both ourselves and others.

---Title---
Life-Span Perspective on Development
---Data---
The Life-Span Perspective (LSP) on development is based on several key assumptions. Firstly, development is a lifelong process that extends across all age groups, from conception to old age, encompassing both gains and losses in various domains. Secondly, the biological, cognitive, and socio-emotional processes are interconnected and influence each other throughout an individual's life. Thirdly, development is multi-directional, meaning that while some abilities may improve with age, others may decline. For instance, life experiences can make adults wiser, but aging may reduce their ability to perform tasks requiring speed. Fourthly, development is highly plastic, meaning that psychological skills and abilities can be modified or improved, although the degree of plasticity varies among individuals. Fifthly, historical and cultural conditions shape development. For example, the experiences of individuals who lived through significant historical events differ greatly from those of people living today. Sixthly, development is studied by multiple disciplines, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and neuroscience, each offering unique insights. Finally, development is influenced by various contexts, such as inherited traits, social environments, and cultural factors. Life events, whether positive or negative, play a crucial role in shaping an individual's developmental trajectory.

---Title---
Growth and Development  
---Data---  
Growth refers to an increase in the size of body parts or of the organism as a whole. It can be measured or quantified, for example, growth in height, weight, etc. Development is a process by which an individual grows and changes throughout the life cycle. The term development applies to the changes that have a direction and hold a definite relationship with what precedes it, and in turn, will determine what will come after. A temporary change caused by a brief illness, for example, is not considered a part of development. All changes which occur as a result of development are not of the same kind.  

---Title--- 
Types of Developmental Changes  
---Data---
Changes in size (physical growth), changes in proportion (child to adult), changes in features (disappearance of baby teeth), and acquiring new features are varied in their pace and scope level. Development includes growth as one of its aspects.  

---Title---
Maturation  
---Data---
Maturation refers to the changes that follow an orderly sequence and are largely dictated by the genetic blueprint which produces commonalities in our growth and development. For example, most children can sit without support by 7 months of age, stand with support by 8 months, and walk by one year. Once the underlying physical structure is sufficiently developed, proficiency in these behaviours requires adequate environment and little practice. However, special efforts to accelerate these behaviours do not help if the infant is maturationally not ready. These processes seem to "unfold from within," following an inner, genetically determined timetable that is characteristic of the species.  

---Title---
Evolution  
---Data---
Evolution refers to species-specific changes. Natural selection is an evolutionary process that favours individuals or a species that are best adapted to survive and reproduce. The evolutionary changes are passed from one generation to the next within a species. Evolution proceeds at a very slow pace. Emergence of human beings from great apes took about 14 million years. It has been estimated that the 'Homo sapiens' came into existence only about 50,000 years ago.  

---Title---
Factors Influencing Development
---Data---
Have you observed in your class that some of you have dark skin, others have light coloured skin, colour of your hair and eyes are different, some of you are tall, others short, some are quiet or sad while others are talkative or cheerful. People also differ with respect to intelligence, learning abilities, memory, and other psychological characteristics besides physical characteristics. Despite these variations, no one can be mistaken for any other species: we all are homo sapiens. What causes us to be different from each other but at the same time more like each other? The answer lies in the interaction of heredity and environment.

---Title---
Heredity and Genetic Transmission
---Data---
The principles of heredity explain the mechanism for transmission of characteristics by every species from one generation to the next. We inherit genetic codes from our parents, which are in every cell of our body. Our genetic codes are alike in one important way; they contain the human genetic code. It is because of the human genetic code that a fertilised human egg grows into a human baby and cannot grow into an elephant, a bird or a mouse. Genetic transmission is very complex. Most characteristics that we observe in humans are combinations of a larger number of genes. You can imagine the combinations produced by 80,000 or more genes – accounting for a variety of characteristics and behaviours. It is also not possible to possess all the characteristics made available to us by our genetic structure.

---Title---
Genotype and Phenotype
---Data---
The actual genetic material or a person’s genetic heritage is known as genotype. However, not all of this genetic material is apparent or distinctly identifiable in our observable characteristics. Phenotype is the way an individual’s genotype is expressed in observable and measurable characteristics. Phenotypes include physical traits, such as height, weight, eye and skin colour, and many of the psychological characteristics such as intelligence, creativity, and personality. These observable characteristics of an individual are the result of the interaction between the person’s inherited traits and the environment.

---Title---
Interaction of Heredity and Environment
---Data---
Genes provide a distinct blueprint and timetable for the development of an individual. But genes do not exist in isolation and development occurs within the context of an individual’s environment. This is what makes each one of us a unique person. The environment can influence how genetic potentials are expressed. For example, a child with genotype that predisposes her/him to be introverted, when placed in an environment that promotes social interaction, may become a little extroverted. Conversely, an individual with 'short' height genes, even if exposed to a very good nutritional environment, will never grow taller than average. This shows that genes set the limit and within that limit, the environment influences development.

---Title---
Parental and Environmental Influences
---Data---
Parents not only provide the genetic material for a child’s development but also play a crucial role in shaping the environment. Sandra Scarr (1992) suggests that the environment parents provide for their children depends, to some extent, on their own genetic predisposition. For instance, intelligent parents who are avid readers are likely to provide books for their children, increasing the likelihood that their children will also develop a love for reading. Additionally, a child’s genotype, such as being cooperative and attentive, may elicit positive responses from teachers and parents, which further reinforces their behaviour. As children grow, they also actively select environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For example, musically talented children might seek musical environments, while athletic children may gravitate towards sports-related settings. This interaction between heredity and environment continues to evolve throughout an individual’s life.

---Title---
Complexity of Environmental Influences
---Data---
Environmental influences are as complex as the genetic factors we inherit. The interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental experiences shapes who we become. For example, if your class monitor is selected for being academically bright and popular, is it due to their genes or the environment? Similarly, an intelligent child from a rural area might struggle to find a job due to a lack of exposure to technology or communication skills. This illustrates how both heredity and environment jointly determine an individual’s developmental outcomes.

---Title---
Context of Development
---Data---
Development does not take place in a vacuum. It is always embedded in a particular socio-cultural context. Transitions during one's lifetime, such as entering school, becoming an adolescent, finding jobs, marrying, having children, and retirement, are joint functions of biological changes and changes in one's environment. The environment can change or alter during any time of the individual's life span.

---Title---
Bronfenbrenner's Contextual View of Development
---Data---
Urie Bronfenbrenner's contextual view of development emphasizes the role of environmental factors in shaping an individual's growth. This model consists of several interconnected systems. The microsystem represents the immediate environment where the child directly interacts with social agents such as family, peers, teachers, and the neighborhood. The mesosystem refers to the relationships between these contexts. For example, how a child's parents interact with teachers or how they view the child's friends influences the child's development. The exosystem involves social settings that the child does not participate in directly but which affect the child's immediate environment. For instance, parental work stress or job transfers can influence the child's access to resources like quality schooling, healthcare, and recreational opportunities. The macrosystem represents the broader cultural context in which the individual lives, including societal beliefs, traditions, and ideologies. Lastly, the chronosystem refers to life events and socio-historical circumstances, such as parental divorce or economic hardships, that impact the child's development over time.

---Title---
Impact of Environmental Factors on Development
---Data---
Bronfenbrenner's model suggests that a child's development is shaped by the complex world surrounding them. This includes both the small details of daily interactions and the larger socio-economic context in which they live. Research indicates that children in impoverished environments often face disadvantages. These environments may lack stimulating resources like books, magazines, and toys, and provide fewer enriching experiences such as visits to libraries, museums, and zoos. Additionally, overcrowded and noisy living conditions, as well as ineffective parental role models, contribute to learning difficulties and developmental challenges.

---Title---
Durganand Sinha's Ecological Model of Development in the Indian Context
---Data---
Durganand Sinha (1977) proposed an ecological model to understand child development in the Indian context. This model consists of two concentric layers. The upper, more visible layer includes the child's immediate environment, such as home, school, and peer groups. Key factors in this layer include the living conditions at home (e.g., space, overcrowding, availability of toys and technology), the nature and quality of schooling, and the child's interactions with peers. These factors continuously interact with one another and shape the child's development. The surrounding layer includes broader ecological factors that are less visible but still influential. These include the geographical environment (e.g., availability of play spaces, population density), institutional settings (e.g., caste and class structures), and general amenities (e.g., access to clean water, electricity, and entertainment facilities). The visible and surrounding layers interact dynamically, and their influence on development can vary between individuals. This ecological environment is not static; it changes throughout a person's life span, making it essential to consider an individual's experiences within their broader context when assessing their development.

---Title---
Overview of Developmental Stages
---Data---
Development occurs in different stages throughout life, each characterized by specific features and developmental tasks. These stages are temporary, with each phase having a dominant characteristic that makes it unique. During each stage, individuals work toward developmental goals in a specific sequence. Although the order of these stages is consistent across individuals, the time or rate at which people progress through them can vary significantly. Certain behaviors and skills are more easily and effectively learned during specific stages, and these accomplishments become social expectations referred to as developmental tasks. These tasks are milestones that guide growth and signal readiness to move to the next developmental phase.

---Title---
Prenatal Stage
---Data---
The prenatal stage spans from conception to birth, typically lasting about 40 weeks. Development during this period is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic material determines fundamental characteristics, while environmental influences such as the mother's age, nutrition, and emotional state significantly affect prenatal growth. Maternal health conditions, diseases, or infections like rubella, genital herpes, and HIV can lead to severe complications or congenital abnormalities. Additionally, prenatal development is vulnerable to teratogens—harmful environmental agents such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, radiation, and pollutants. These substances can cause permanent developmental issues or even fetal death. For instance, exposure to industrial chemicals or radiation can damage genetic material, while drug and alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the likelihood of congenital disabilities. The prenatal stage is crucial because early environmental exposures can have long-lasting effects on physical and cognitive development.

---Title---
Infancy
---Data---
Infancy spans from birth to around two years of age, during which rapid physical, sensory, cognitive, and socio-emotional development occurs. This stage is marked by significant growth in brain function, motor skills, sensory perception, and the formation of emotional bonds.

---Title---
Motor Development
---Data---
Newborns' movements are primarily governed by reflexes—automatic, built-in responses to stimuli. Reflexes, such as sucking and grasping, are survival mechanisms that gradually give way to voluntary motor control as the brain matures. Basic physical (motor) skills develop in a universal sequence, including grasping, sitting, crawling, and walking. This progression is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.

---Title---
Sensory Abilities
---Data---
Despite their fragile appearance, newborns possess a range of sensory capabilities. They can distinguish their mother’s voice from others shortly after birth and can locate the direction of sounds. Visual acuity is limited at birth but improves significantly within the first year. While infants may initially be color-deficient, full color vision typically develops by three months of age. Newborns are also responsive to touch, can experience pain, and have functioning senses of taste and smell.

---Title---
Cognitive Development
---Data---
According to Jean Piaget, infants actively construct their understanding of the world through sensory experiences and motor actions. During the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years), infants explore their environment by looking, touching, mouthing, and grasping. Initially, they lack "object permanence"—the awareness that objects continue to exist even when out of sight. By around 8 months of age, infants begin to understand object permanence, indicating a significant cognitive milestone. Early language skills also emerge during infancy, beginning with cooing and babbling, which eventually develop into meaningful speech.

---Title---
Socio-emotional Development
---Data---
From birth, infants exhibit social behaviors and form emotional bonds with caregivers. By 6 to 8 months, infants typically show a preference for familiar faces and become distressed when separated from their primary caregiver. This emotional bond, known as attachment, is crucial for healthy socio-emotional development. A classic study by Harlow and Harlow (1962) demonstrated the importance of "contact comfort" in attachment formation. Baby monkeys raised by surrogate mothers preferred soft, cloth-covered figures over wire figures, regardless of which provided food. Similarly, human infants develop secure attachments when caregivers are responsive and sensitive to their needs. According to Erik Erikson, the first year of life is characterized by the developmental task of establishing trust versus mistrust. Responsive caregiving fosters a sense of security, while inconsistent or neglectful care may lead to feelings of insecurity and self-doubt.

---Title---
Childhood
---Data---
The child’s growth slows down during early childhood as compared to infancy. The child develops physically, gains height and weight, learns to walk, runs, jumps, and plays with a ball. Socially, the child’s world expands from the parents to the family and adults near home and at school. The child also begins to acquire the concepts of good and bad, i.e., develops a sense of morality. During childhood, children have increased physical capacities, can perform tasks independently, can set goals, and meet adult expectations. The increasing maturation of the brain along with opportunities to experience the world contribute to the development of children’s cognitive abilities.

---Title---
Piaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development
---Data---
Sensorimotor (0-2 years): Infant explores the world by coordinating sensory experiences with physical actions.

Preoperational (2-7 years): Symbolic thought develops; object permanence is established; the child cannot coordinate different physical attributes of an object.

Concrete operational (7-11 years): The child can reason logically about concrete events and classify objects into different sets. Is able to perform reversible mental operations on representations of objects.

Formal operational (11-15 years): The adolescent can apply logic more abstractly; hypothetical thinking develops.

---Title---
Physical Development
---Data---
Early development follows two principles: (i) development proceeds cephalocaudally, i.e., from the cephalic or head region to the caudal or tail region. Children gain control over the upper part of the body before the lower part. This is why you would notice that the infant’s head is proportionately larger than her/his body during early infancy or if you see an infant crawling, s/he will use the arms first and then shift to using the legs. (ii) Growth proceeds from the center of the body and moves towards the extremities or more distal regions — the proximodistal trend, i.e., children gain control over their torso before their extremities. Initially, infants reach for objects by turning their entire body, gradually they extend their arms to reach for things. These changes are the result of a maturing nervous system and not because of any limitation since even visually impaired children show the same sequence. As children grow older, they look slimmer as the trunk part of their bodies lengthens and body fat decreases. The brain and the head grow more rapidly than any other part of the body. The growth and development of the brain are important as they help in the maturation of children’s abilities, such as eye-hand coordination, holding a pencil, and attempts made at writing. During middle and late childhood years, children increase significantly in size and strength; increase in weight is mainly due to an increase in the size of the skeletal and muscular systems, as well as the size of some body organs.

---Title---
Motor Development
---Data---
Gross motor skills during the early childhood years involve the use of arms and legs and moving around with confidence and more purposefully in the environment. Fine motor skills—finger dexterity and eye-hand coordination—improve substantially during early childhood. During these years, the child’s preference for the left or right hand also develops. The major accomplishments in gross and fine motor skills during early childhood years are significant milestones in development.

---Title---
Cognitive Development
---Data---
The child’s ability to acquire the concept of object permanence enables her/him to use mental symbols to represent objects. However, the child at this stage lacks the ability that allows her/him to do mentally what was done physically before. Cognitive development in early childhood focuses on Piaget’s stage of preoperational thought. The child gains the ability to mentally represent an object that is not physically present. This ability of the child to engage in symbolic thought helps to expand her/his mental world. A salient feature of preoperational thought is egocentrism (self-focus), i.e., children see the world only in terms of their own selves and are not able to appreciate others’ points of view. Children, because of egocentrism, engage in animism—thinking that all things are living, like oneself. They attribute life-like qualities to inanimate objects. For example, if a child while running slips on the road, s/he might show animism by saying, “road hurt me.” As children grow and are approximately between 4 and 7 years of age, they want answers to all their questions like: Why is the sky blue? How do trees grow? Such questions help the child to know why things are as they are. Piaget called this the stage of intuitive thought. Another feature of thought during the preoperational stage is characterized by children having a tendency for centration, i.e., focusing on a single characteristic or feature for understanding an event. For example, a child may insist on drinking a “big glass” of juice, preferring a tall narrow glass to a short broad one, even though both might be holding the same amount of juice. As the child grows and is approximately between 7 and 11 years of age (the period of middle and late childhood), intuitive thought is replaced by logical thought. This is the stage of concrete operational thought, which is made up of operations—mental actions that allow the child to do mentally what was done physically before. Concrete operations are also mental actions that are reversible.

---Title---
Socio-emotional Development
---Data---
The important dimensions of children’s socio-emotional development are the self, gender, and moral development. During the early years of childhood, some important developments in the self take place. The child, due to socialization, has developed a sense of who s/he is and whom s/he wants to be identified with. The developing sense of independence makes children do things in their own way. According to Erikson, the way parents respond to their self-initiated activities leads to developing a sense of initiative or a sense of guilt. For example, giving freedom and opportunities for play like cycling, running, skating, etc., and answering children’s questions will create a sense of support for the initiative taken. In contrast, if they are made to feel that their questions are useless, and games played by them are stupid, the children are likely to develop feelings of guilt over self-initiated activities, which may persist through the children’s later life also.

---Title---
Moral Development
---Data---
Another important aspect of the child’s development is learning to differentiate between the rightness or wrongness of human acts. The way children come to distinguish right from wrong, to feel guilty, to put themselves in other people’s positions, and to help others when they are in trouble, are all components of moral development. According to Lawrence Kohlberg, children pass through various stages of moral development, which are age-related. Kohlberg interviewed children with stories where characters faced moral dilemmas and asked what the characters should do and why. According to him, children approach thinking about right and wrong differently at different ages. Young children (before 9 years of age) think in terms of external authority. As they grow, by early adolescence, they develop moral reasoning through a set of rules of others, such as parents or laws of society. Over time, they gradually develop a personal moral code.

---Title---
Challenges of adolescence
---Data---
The term adolescence derives from the Latin word *adolescere*, meaning "to grow into maturity." It represents the transitional phase between childhood and adulthood, beginning at puberty when sexual maturity and the ability to reproduce are attained. This stage is marked by rapid biological and psychological changes. While the physical transformations during adolescence are universal, the social and psychological experiences vary based on cultural contexts. In some cultures, adolescence is viewed as a confusing and problematic period, while in others, it is seen as the beginning of adult responsibilities. Although adolescence exists in most societies, it is not a universally defined phase across all cultures.  

---Title---
Physical Development in adolescence
---Data---  
Adolescence is characterized by significant physical changes due to puberty, a gradual process marking the end of childhood. Hormonal changes trigger the development of primary sexual characteristics (reproductive organs) and secondary sexual characteristics (physical signs of maturity such as facial hair and voice changes in boys and breast development in girls). For boys, the growth spurt typically starts at ages 12 to 13, while for girls, it begins earlier at around 10 to 11 years, with menarche (the onset of menstruation) following soon after. Genetic and environmental factors influence the timing of these changes. For example, identical twins experience menarche closer together than fraternal twins, and girls from affluent families tend to mature earlier due to better nutrition and healthcare. Alongside physical changes, adolescents experience psychological shifts such as increased interest in the opposite sex and sexual matters. This heightened awareness is influenced by biological changes and societal emphasis on sexuality. However, many adolescents lack accurate knowledge about sex due to limited communication with parents and societal taboos. Concerns about adolescent sexuality have intensified due to the risks of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the importance of developing a healthy sexual identity during this stage.  

---Title---  
Cognitive Developmental Changes  
---Data---  
During adolescence, cognitive abilities advance significantly, allowing for abstract, logical, and idealistic thinking. According to Piaget, adolescents enter the formal operational stage between ages 11 and 15, where they can reason beyond concrete experiences, think systematically, and explore hypothetical scenarios. This development enables them to analyze problems, consider multiple solutions, and make more informed decisions. Adolescents also become more reflective, often comparing themselves and others to ideal standards, leading to self-evaluation and questioning of social norms. Moral reasoning also becomes more flexible during this stage. Adolescents start questioning societal rules, considering alternative moral frameworks, and developing a personal code of ethics. This newfound ability to reason morally may lead them to challenge authority or engage in social causes. David Elkind describes adolescent egocentrism through two concepts: the "imaginary audience" and the "personal fable." The imaginary audience refers to the belief that others are constantly watching and judging them, making adolescents highly self-conscious. The personal fable reflects a sense of uniqueness, where adolescents feel that their experiences are incomparable and misunderstood by others. This belief often leads to the perception that they are invincible or exempt from ordinary risks.  

---Title---  
Forming an Identity  
---Data---  
One of the primary developmental tasks during adolescence is the formation of a personal identity. Adolescents grapple with questions like "Who am I?" and "What do I believe in?" as they strive to establish an identity separate from their parents. According to Erik Erikson’s theory, this stage is defined by the conflict of identity versus role confusion. Successful navigation leads to a coherent self-identity, while failure results in identity confusion, which may cause isolation or conformity to peer pressures. The process of identity formation is influenced by several factors, including family values, cultural background, socioeconomic status, and peer relationships. During this period, adolescents often seek independence while still relying on parental support. They may fluctuate between self-confidence and insecurity, expressing frustration at being treated like children while simultaneously seeking comfort from their parents. Peer groups play a crucial role in shaping identity by providing social support and opportunities to experiment with different behaviors. Additionally, vocational choices become a major concern, requiring adolescents to think about their future and set realistic career goals. In some cultures, adolescents have the freedom to choose their career paths, while in others, family decisions hold greater authority. Career counseling in schools helps guide adolescents in making informed decisions about their professional futures.  

---Title---  
Delinquency  
---Data---  
Delinquency refers to a range of antisocial behaviors and legal offenses committed by adolescents, including truancy, theft, vandalism, and running away from home. Delinquent behavior is often associated with a negative self-identity, low academic achievement, and diminished trust in others. Family-related factors such as poor parental support, inconsistent discipline, and family discord contribute to delinquency. Socioeconomic challenges, such as poverty and unemployment, also increase the likelihood of delinquent behavior. Adolescents may engage in delinquent acts to gain peer approval or attention. However, most delinquent adolescents do not remain so permanently. Positive peer influences, increased social awareness, and improved self-concept can help reduce delinquent behaviors. Intervention programs that provide role models, promote social responsibility, and enhance self-esteem play a crucial role in rehabilitating delinquent youth.  

---Title---  
Substance Abuse  
---Data---  
Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to substance abuse, including smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use. Reasons for substance use include peer pressure, a desire to appear mature, stress relief, and the need to escape social or academic pressures. Adolescents who are impulsive, aggressive, anxious, or have low self-esteem are more likely to engage in substance abuse. The addictive nature of substances like nicotine makes it difficult to quit once use begins. Continued substance abuse can lead to physical dependence and long-term harm to health and personal development. Prevention efforts focus on fostering positive relationships with parents, peers, and supportive adults. Effective programs, like the Society for Theatre in Education Programme in New Delhi, use creative approaches such as street performances to educate young people about the dangers of substance abuse and encourage them to say no to drugs.  

---Title---
Eating Disorders  
---Data---
Eating disorders are a significant concern during adolescence, often driven by body image obsession and societal pressures. Anorexia nervosa involves extreme dieting and self-starvation in the pursuit of thinness, while bulimia is characterized by binge eating followed by purging through vomiting or laxative use. Media representations that idealize thinness contribute to these disorders, as adolescents strive to meet unrealistic beauty standards. Peer comparisons and the desire to conform further intensify these behaviors. Anorexia and bulimia primarily affect females, although males are also susceptible. Early intervention and counseling are essential in addressing these disorders, promoting a healthy self-image, and providing emotional support to affected adolescents.  

---Title---
Adulthood
---Data---
An adult is generally defined as someone who is responsible, mature, self-supporting, and well-integrated into society. However, the development of these attributes varies, leading to differences in when individuals assume adult roles. Some people take up jobs while pursuing college studies, while others may continue living with their parents even after becoming financially independent. The assumption of adult roles is influenced by social contexts, and the timing of major life events such as marriage, employment, and parenthood varies across cultures. Within a given culture, however, there is usually a shared trajectory of adult development. In early adulthood, two major tasks include exploring possibilities for adult living and establishing a stable life structure. The twenties are considered the novice phase of adult development, during which individuals transition from dependence to independence. This transition often involves envisioning future life goals, particularly regarding marriage and career.

---Title---
Career and Work
---Data---
Earning a living, selecting an occupation, and developing a career are significant milestones in adulthood. Entering the workforce presents challenges, including adjusting to new environments, proving competence, managing competition, and meeting expectations from both employers and oneself. This period marks the beginning of new roles and responsibilities. As individuals progress in their careers, they engage in self-evaluation and refine their professional goals. Career development becomes a central focus during adulthood, shaping identity and future aspirations.

---Title---
Marriage, Parenthood, and Family
---Data---
Entering marriage requires adjustments to accommodate each partner’s preferences, habits, and responsibilities. If both partners are working, they must navigate shared household duties and balance personal and professional lives. Parenthood is another significant transition that, while often accompanied by love for the child, can be stressful. Factors such as family size, social support, and marital satisfaction influence how adults experience parenting. The death of a spouse or divorce can create single-parent households where one parent assumes the responsibility of raising children. Additionally, the rise of dual-career families presents challenges similar to those faced by single working parents, including managing childcare, household tasks, and professional obligations. Despite these stressors, parenting offers a unique opportunity for personal growth and provides a sense of purpose by nurturing the next generation.

---Title---
Physical and Cognitive Changes in Middle Age
---Data---
Middle adulthood is marked by gradual physical changes due to natural aging. Although the rate of these changes varies, most people in middle age experience a decline in vision, sensitivity to glare, hearing loss, and physical changes such as wrinkles, greying or thinning hair, and weight gain. Cognitive abilities also undergo changes, with long-term memory showing greater decline compared to short-term memory. For instance, a middle-aged individual may easily recall a recently heard telephone number but struggle to remember it after a few days. However, while memory may decline, wisdom and problem-solving abilities often improve with age. Individual differences in cognitive abilities persist throughout adulthood, with some adults displaying exceptional intelligence and others showing signs of cognitive decline.

---Title---
Old Age
---Data---
Defining when old age begins is complex, especially as people live longer and retirement ages shift. Traditional markers such as retirement are no longer clear indicators of old age. Older adults face various challenges, including retirement, widowhood, illness, and family losses. However, societal perceptions of old age are evolving. Many individuals over seventy remain active, creative, and engaged in fields like politics, literature, business, art, and science. Successful aging depends on socio-economic conditions, healthcare availability, social attitudes, and support systems. Over a lifetime, priorities shift from work during early adulthood to family in middle age and health in later years. Effective aging involves maintaining productive work, loving relationships, strong friendships, and cognitive health.

---Title---
Retirement and Adjustment
---Data---
Retirement marks a significant life transition that individuals perceive differently. Some view it negatively as a loss of purpose and identity, while others embrace it as an opportunity to pursue personal interests. Older adults who are open to new experiences and maintain a sense of purpose tend to adapt better to retirement. Adjusting to family changes is another challenge during old age. With children establishing independent lives, older adults may experience loneliness and increased dependence on their families for emotional and financial support. Feelings of insecurity and depression may arise when individuals perceive a loss of control over their lives.

---Title---
Dependency and Cultural Attitudes
---Data---
In many cultures, including Indian society, the elderly depend on their children for care and support. This cultural expectation creates a sense of security for older adults. However, feelings of loss, declining health, and financial insecurity can increase emotional dependency. Providing emotional support and ensuring the well-being of elderly family members is essential, as everyone eventually faces the process of aging. The loss of a spouse is especially difficult, as it often leads to profound grief, loneliness, financial strain, and health risks. Since women tend to outlive men, widows are more common than widowers. Support from family and friends plays a crucial role in helping older adults cope with such losses.

---Title---
Cultural Perspectives on Death
---Data---
Different cultures perceive death in unique ways. In the Gond culture of India, death is attributed to magical or supernatural forces, while the Tanala culture of Madagascar believes natural forces cause death. Cultural beliefs shape attitudes toward mortality and influence how people cope with the death of loved ones. Understanding these diverse perspectives helps foster compassion and awareness as individuals navigate the human life cycle.

---Title---
Overview of Psychological Disorders
---Data---
Although many definitions of abnormality have been used over the years, none has won universal acceptance. Still, most definitions have certain common features, often called the 'four Ds': deviance, distress, dysfunction, and danger. That is, psychological disorders are deviant (different, extreme, unusual, even bizarre), distressing (unpleasant and upsetting to the person and to others), dysfunctional (interfering with the person's ability to carry out daily activities in a constructive way), and possibly dangerous (to the person or to others). This definition is a useful starting point from which we can explore psychological abnormality. Since the word 'abnormal' literally means "away from the normal," it implies deviation from some clearly defined norms or standards. In psychology, we have no 'ideal model' or even 'normal model' of human behaviour to use as a base for comparison. Various approaches have been used in distinguishing between normal and abnormal behaviours.

Understanding Psychological Disorders
---Data---
You must have come across people who are unhappy, troubled, and dissatisfied. Their minds and hearts are filled with sorrow, unrest, and tension, and they feel that they are unable to move ahead in their lives; they feel life is a painful, uphill struggle, sometimes not worth living. Famous analytical psychologist Carl Jung has quite remarkably said, "How can I be substantial without casting a shadow? I must have a dark side, too, if I am to be whole and by becoming conscious of my shadow, I remember once more that I am a human being like any other." At times, some of you may have felt nervous before an important examination, tense and concerned about your future career, or anxious when someone close to you was unwell. All of us face major problems at some point in our lives. However, some people have an extreme reaction to the problems and stresses of life. In this chapter, we will try to understand what goes wrong when people develop psychological problems, what are the causes and factors which lead to abnormal behaviour, and what are the various signs and symptoms associated with different types of psychological disorders.

---Title---
Approaches to Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
From these approaches, there emerge two basic and conflicting views. The first approach views abnormal behaviour as a deviation from social norms. Many psychologists have stated that 'abnormal' is simply a label that is given to a behaviour which is deviant from social expectations. Abnormal behaviour, thoughts, and emotions are those that differ markedly from a society's ideas of proper functioning. Each society has norms, which are stated or unstated rules for proper conduct. Behaviours, thoughts, and emotions that break societal norms are called abnormal. A society's norms grow from its particular culture—its history, values, institutions, habits, skills, technology, and arts. Thus, a society whose culture values competition and assertiveness may accept aggressive behaviour, whereas one that emphasises cooperation and family values (such as in India) may consider aggressive behaviour as unacceptable or even abnormal. A society's values may change over time, causing its views of what is psychologically abnormal to change as well. The second approach views abnormal behaviour as maladaptive. Many psychologists believe that the best criterion for determining the normality of behaviour is not whether society accepts it but whether it fosters the well-being of the individual and eventually of the group to which they belong. Well-being is not simply maintenance and survival but also includes growth and fulfilment, i.e., the actualisation of potential, which you must have studied in Maslow's need hierarchy theory. According to this criterion, conforming behaviour can be seen as abnormal if it is maladaptive, i.e., if it interferes with optimal functioning and growth.

---Title---
Misconceptions and Stigma
---Data---
If you talk to people around, you will see that they have vague ideas about psychological disorders that are characterised by superstition, ignorance, and fear. Again, it is commonly believed that psychological disorder is something to be ashamed of. The stigma attached to mental illness means that people are hesitant to consult a doctor or psychologist because they are ashamed of their problems. Actually, psychological disorder which indicates a failure in adaptation should be viewed as any other illness.

---Title---
Historical Background
---Data---
To understand psychological disorders, we would require a brief historical account of how these disorders have been viewed over the ages. When we study the history of abnormal psychology, we find that certain theories have occurred over and over again. One ancient theory that is still encountered today holds that abnormal behaviour can be explained by the operation of supernatural and magical forces such as evil spirits (bhoot-pret), or the devil (shaitan). Exorcism, i.e., removing the evil that resides in the individual through countermagic and prayer, is still commonly used. In many societies, the shaman, or medicine man (ojha), is a person who is believed to have contact with supernatural forces and is the medium through which spirits communicate with human beings. A recurring theme in the history of abnormal psychology is the belief that individuals behave strangely because their bodies and their brains are not working properly. This is the biological or organic approach. In the modern era, there is evidence that body and brain processes have been linked to many types of maladaptive behaviour. Another approach is the psychological approach. According to this point of view, psychological problems are caused by inadequacies in the way an individual thinks, feels, or perceives the world. All three of these perspectives—supernatural, biological or organic, and psychological—have recurred throughout the history of Western civilisation. During the Middle Ages, demonology and superstition gained renewed importance in the explanation of abnormal behaviour. In the Renaissance Period, increased humanism and curiosity about behaviour emerged. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries marked the Age of Reason and Enlightenment, where the scientific method replaced faith and dogma. In recent years, there has been a convergence of these approaches, resulting in an interactional, or bio-psycho-social approach, where biological, psychological, and social factors play important roles in influencing psychological disorders.

---Title---
Classification of Psychological Disorders
---Data---
In order to understand psychological disorders, we need to begin by classifying them. A classification of such disorders consists of a list of categories of specific psychological disorders grouped into various classes on the basis of some shared characteristics. Classifications are useful because they enable users like psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers to communicate with each other about the disorder and help in understanding the causes of psychological disorders and the processes involved in their development and maintenance.

---Title---
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5)
---Data---
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has published an official manual describing and classifying various kinds of psychological disorders. The current version of it, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), presents discrete clinical criteria which indicate the presence or absence of disorders.

---Title---
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)
---Data---
The classification scheme officially used in India and elsewhere is the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which is known as the ICD-10 Classification of Behavioural and Mental Disorders. It was prepared by the World Health Organisation (WHO). For each disorder, a description of the main clinical features or symptoms, and of other associated features including diagnostic guidelines is provided in this scheme.

---Title---
Contextual Understanding of Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
Certain behaviours like eating sand would be considered abnormal. But not if it was done after being stranded on a beach in a plane crash. Listed below are 'abnormal' behaviours followed by situations where the behaviours might be considered normal. (i) talking to yourself - you are praying. (ii) standing in the middle of the street waving your arms wildly - you are a traffic policeman. Think about it and list similar examples.

---Title---
Factors Underlying Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
In order to understand something as complex as abnormal behaviour, psychologists use different approaches. Each approach in use today emphasises a different aspect of human behaviour and explains and treats abnormality in line with that aspect. These approaches also emphasise the role of different factors such as biological, psychological and interpersonal, and socio-cultural factors. We will examine some of the approaches which are currently being used to explain abnormal behaviour.

---Title---
Biological Factors Causing Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
Biological factors influence all aspects of our behaviour. A wide range of biological factors such as faulty genes, endocrine imbalances, malnutrition, injuries, and other conditions may interfere with normal development and functioning of the human body. These factors may be potential causes of abnormal behaviour. According to the biological model, abnormal behaviour has a biochemical or physiological basis. Researchers have found that psychological disorders are often related to problems in the transmission of messages from one neuron to another. Abnormal activity by certain neurotransmitters can lead to specific psychological disorders. Anxiety disorders have been linked to low activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), schizophrenia to excess activity of dopamine, and depression to low activity of serotonin. Genetic factors have been linked to bipolar and related disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and other psychological disorders. However, researchers have not identified specific genes responsible, and it is believed that multiple genes combine to influence behaviour and psychological disorders. While biological factors play a significant role, they cannot account for all mental disorders alone.

---Title---
Psychological Factors Causing Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
Several psychological models provide explanations for mental disorders. These models focus on psychological and interpersonal factors that contribute to abnormal behaviour. Such factors include maternal deprivation, faulty parent-child relationships, maladaptive family structures, and severe stress. The primary psychological models are the psychodynamic, behavioural, cognitive, and humanistic-existential models. The psychodynamic model, first formulated by Freud, suggests that abnormal behaviour is caused by unconscious psychological forces. These forces—instinctual needs (id), rational thinking (ego), and moral standards (superego)—interact and may lead to internal conflicts that manifest as abnormal behaviour. The behavioural model suggests that both normal and abnormal behaviours are learned. It explains that maladaptive behaviours are the result of conditioning, which includes classical conditioning (associating two events), operant conditioning (behaviour followed by rewards), and social learning (learning through imitation). According to this model, what has been learned can also be unlearned. The cognitive model posits that abnormal functioning arises from cognitive distortions. Irrational beliefs, illogical thinking patterns, and overgeneralisation—drawing broad negative conclusions from minor events—can lead to psychological distress. The humanistic-existential model emphasises broader aspects of human existence. Humanists believe that individuals are driven toward self-actualisation, while existentialists focus on personal responsibility and the freedom to give meaning to one's life. Avoiding this responsibility may lead to dysfunction.

---Title---
Socio-Cultural Factors Causing Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
Socio-cultural factors also play a significant role in abnormal behaviour. Social conditions such as war, violence, prejudice, discrimination, economic hardship, and rapid social change can contribute to psychological distress. According to the socio-cultural model, abnormal behaviour must be understood within the context of the social and cultural environment. Family structure, social networks, and societal conditions influence mental health. Dysfunctional family systems and a lack of social support may increase the risk of psychological disorders. Societal labels and roles also shape behaviour—when individuals are labelled as 'mentally ill,' they may internalise this label and exhibit further dysfunctional behaviour.

---Title---
The Diathesis-Stress Model of Abnormal Behaviour
---Data---
One of the most widely accepted explanations of abnormal behaviour is the diathesis-stress model. This model suggests that psychological disorders arise when a biological predisposition (diathesis) is triggered by environmental stressors. The model has three components: (1) the biological vulnerability, (2) the increased risk or predisposition to develop a disorder, and (3) the presence of environmental stressors. If an at-risk individual experiences these stressors, the predisposition may develop into a psychological disorder. This model has been applied to conditions such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.

---Title---
Anxiety Disorder
---Data---
Generalised anxiety disorder consists of prolonged, vague, unexplained, and intense fears that are not attached to any particular object. The symptoms include worry and apprehensive feelings about the future; hypervigilance, which involves constantly scanning the environment for dangers. It is marked by motor tension, as a result of which the person is unable to relax, is restless, and visibly shaky and tense.

---Title---
Panic Disorder
---Data---
Panic disorder consists of recurrent anxiety attacks in which the person experiences intense terror. A panic attack denotes an abrupt surge of intense anxiety rising to a peak when thoughts of a particular stimuli are present. Such thoughts occur in an unpredictable manner. The clinical features include shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling, palpitations, choking, nausea, chest pain or discomfort, fear of going crazy, losing control or dying.

---Title---
Phobias
---Data---
Phobias are irrational fears related to specific objects, people, or situations. There are three main types of phobias: specific phobias (such as fear of animals or enclosed spaces), social phobias (fear of embarrassment in social situations), and agoraphobia (fear of unfamiliar situations or leaving home).

---Title---
Separation Anxiety Disorder
---Data---
Separation anxiety disorder is characterised by extreme distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or significant attachment figures. Children with SAD may be fearful of being alone, refuse to go to school, and show physical symptoms like stomachaches or headaches when separation occurs.

---Title---
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
---Data---
Have you ever noticed someone washing their hands every time they touch something, or washing even things like coins, or stepping only within the patterns on the floor or road while walking? People affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder are unable to control their preoccupation with specific ideas or are unable to prevent themselves from repeatedly carrying out a particular act or series of acts that affect their ability to carry out normal activities.Obsessive behaviour is the inability to stop thinking about a particular idea or topic. The person involved, often finds these thoughts to be unpleasant and shameful. Compulsive behaviour is the need to perform certain behaviours over and over again. Many compulsions deal with counting, ordering, checking, touching and washing. Other disorders in this category include hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, etc.

---Title---  
Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders  
---Data---  
Trauma- and stressor-related disorders often affect people who have experienced life-threatening or distressing events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, serious accidents, or war-related situations. One of the most recognized conditions under this category is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD manifests through a range of symptoms, including recurrent dreams, intrusive flashbacks, impaired concentration, and emotional numbness. These symptoms can significantly disrupt daily life and emotional well-being. Additionally, this category includes Adjustment Disorders and Acute Stress Disorder, both of which also result from experiencing traumatic or highly stressful events.  

---Title---  
Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders  
---Data---  
Somatic symptom and related disorders involve physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by any medical condition. Individuals with these disorders experience psychological distress that manifests through physical complaints without an identifiable biological cause. This category encompasses conversion disorders, somatic symptom disorder, and illness anxiety disorder, among others. In somatic symptom disorder, individuals report persistent bodily symptoms, which may or may not have a medical explanation. Such individuals tend to worry excessively about their health, frequently visit doctors, and experience significant distress and interference in their daily activities. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by an ongoing preoccupation with the fear of developing a serious illness, despite medical reassurance. Those affected remain anxious about their health, are unconvinced by negative diagnostic tests, and can become easily alarmed by illness-related information. While both disorders are related to medical concerns, somatic symptom disorder is marked by actual physical complaints, whereas illness anxiety disorder is dominated by persistent anxiety about illness. Conversion disorders, another form of somatic symptom disorder, involve the sudden loss of bodily functions such as paralysis, blindness, deafness, or difficulty walking, usually following a stressful event.  

---Title---  
Dissociative Disorders  
---Data---  
Dissociative disorders involve a disruption in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception. People with these disorders may experience a sense of unreality, estrangement, depersonalization, or shifts in identity. These symptoms often arise as a coping mechanism to block out traumatic or distressing experiences. The primary types of dissociative disorders include Dissociative Amnesia, Dissociative Identity Disorder, and Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. Dissociative amnesia involves extensive but selective memory loss without any organic cause. A specific subtype, dissociative fugue, is marked by sudden travel away from home, the adoption of a new identity, and an inability to recall the previous identity. The fugue state ends abruptly, with the person having no memory of the fugue period, often following severe stress. Dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder, is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personalities within the same individual, often linked to childhood trauma. These alternate identities may or may not be aware of one another. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder involves a persistent or recurrent feeling of being detached from one's self or surroundings, resulting in a dreamlike or altered perception of reality.

---Title---  
Depressive Disorders  
---Data---  
Depressive disorders are among the most common and recognized mental health conditions, encompassing a range of negative moods and behavioral changes. Depression can refer to both a symptom and a disorder. In everyday conversation, the term is often used to describe feelings of sadness following significant life events, such as the loss of a relationship or failure to achieve important goals. Major depressive disorder is diagnosed when an individual experiences a persistent depressed mood or loss of interest in most activities, accompanied by symptoms such as changes in body weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, impaired concentration, agitation, slowed behavior, and thoughts of death or suicide. Feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt are also common. Several factors increase the risk of developing depressive disorders, including genetic predisposition, age, and gender. Women are at higher risk during young adulthood, while men are more vulnerable during early middle age. Negative life experiences and lack of social support further contribute to the likelihood of developing depression.  

---Title---  
Bipolar and Related Disorders  
---Data---  
Bipolar and related disorders are characterized by alternating episodes of mania and depression, with periods of normal mood in between. Bipolar I disorder is the most severe form, where manic episodes alternate with depressive episodes. Manic episodes are rarely isolated and often follow or precede depressive periods. Previously known as manic-depressive disorder, bipolar conditions also include Bipolar II disorder, which involves less intense manic phases, and Cyclothymic Disorder, which features chronic mood fluctuations without meeting the criteria for full manic or depressive episodes. These disorders significantly impact a person’s emotional stability, cognitive function, and daily life.  

---Title---  
Suicide and Prevention  
---Data---  
Suicide is a tragic and preventable outcome resulting from a complex interaction of biological, psychological, genetic, sociocultural, and environmental factors. Key risk factors for suicide include mental disorders such as depression and alcohol misuse, exposure to violence, abuse, isolation, and previous suicide attempts. Acute emotional distress and difficulties in problem-solving or managing stress may increase suicidal thoughts, which can escalate to action when individuals perceive no other solution to their problems. Suicide has profound and long-lasting effects on families and communities, yet stigma surrounding it often prevents individuals from seeking help. Preventing suicide requires a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach involving the government, media, and civil society. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends measures such as limiting access to means of suicide, responsible media reporting, implementing alcohol-related policies, early identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, training healthcare workers to manage suicidal behavior, and providing community support for those who have attempted suicide.  

---Title---  
Identifying Students in Distress  
---Data---  
Recognizing signs of distress in students is crucial for early intervention. Sudden changes in academic performance, attendance, or behavior should be taken seriously. Warning signs include loss of interest in common activities, declining grades, reduced effort, classroom misbehavior, frequent or unexplained absences, and engagement in substance use like smoking, drinking, or drug misuse. Identifying these indicators allows timely support and prevention of further emotional deterioration.  

---Title---  
Strengthening Students' Self-Esteem  
---Data---  
Building positive self-esteem is essential for helping students cope with distress and navigate life challenges effectively. Strategies to strengthen self-esteem include promoting positive life experiences to foster a confident identity, providing opportunities for physical, social, and vocational skill development, and encouraging open and trustful communication. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals can also help students develop a sense of accomplishment and resilience, equipping them to manage stress more effectively.

---Title---  
Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders  
---Data---  
Schizophrenia refers to a group of psychotic disorders characterized by deteriorating personal, social, and occupational functioning. This results from disturbed thought processes, unusual perceptions, abnormal emotional states, and motor irregularities. It is a debilitating disorder that imposes significant social and psychological costs on patients, families, and society.

---Title---  
Symptoms of Schizophrenia  
---Data---  
Schizophrenia symptoms fall into three categories: positive symptoms (excesses of thought, emotion, and behavior), negative symptoms (deficits of thought, emotion, and behavior), and psychomotor symptoms. Positive symptoms include delusions, disorganized thinking and speech, heightened perception, hallucinations, and inappropriate affect. Delusions are false beliefs held despite contrary evidence. Common types include delusions of persecution (believing one is being targeted or harmed), delusions of reference (assigning personal meaning to random events), delusions of grandeur (believing one has special powers or status), and delusions of control (believing external forces control one's actions). Disorganized speech can manifest as loose associations, neologisms (inventing new words), and perseveration (repeating thoughts). Hallucinations are sensory perceptions without external stimuli. Auditory hallucinations, where patients hear voices, are the most common. Other types include tactile (tingling sensations), somatic (internal bodily sensations), visual (seeing objects or people), gustatory (strange tastes), and olfactory (unusual smells). Negative symptoms include poverty of speech (alogia), blunted and flat affect (reduced emotional expression), avolition (lack of motivation), and social withdrawal. These impairments reduce a person's ability to engage with others and manage daily responsibilities. Psychomotor symptoms include unusual physical movements or a reduction in spontaneous activity. Severe forms, known as catatonia, involve extreme immobility (catatonic stupor), rigid posture (catatonic rigidity), or maintaining awkward positions for extended periods (catatonic posturing).

---Title---  
Neurodevelopmental Disorders  
---Data---  
Neurodevelopmental disorders emerge during early development and impact personal, social, academic, and occupational functioning. They are marked by deficits or delays in age-appropriate behavior. Major neurodevelopmental disorders include Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, and Specific Learning Disorder. ADHD is characterized by inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Inattentive children struggle to maintain focus, follow instructions, and organize tasks. Impulsive behavior involves acting without considering consequences, while hyperactivity manifests as constant motion and an inability to remain still. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves impairments in social interaction, communication, and restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. Individuals with ASD often struggle with forming relationships, understanding emotions, and maintaining routines. Approximately 70% of individuals with ASD also exhibit intellectual disabilities. Intellectual Disability refers to below-average intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 or below) combined with limitations in adaptive behavior, including communication, self-care, and social skills. These difficulties emerge before age 18. Specific Learning Disorder involves difficulties in reading, writing, or mathematics despite normal intelligence. This condition becomes apparent during school years and affects academic performance and daily functioning.

---Title---  
Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders  
---Data---  
Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders include patterns of aggressive and defiant behavior that violate societal norms and the rights of others. Major conditions in this category are Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder. ODD is characterized by persistent irritability, defiance, and hostile behavior. Affected individuals often justify their actions as responses to external demands and do not view themselves as problematic. Conduct Disorder involves severe violations of societal norms, including aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness, theft, and serious rule-breaking. Aggressive behavior may be verbal (name-calling), physical (fighting), hostile (inflicting harm), or proactive (bullying others without provocation).

---Title---  
Feeding and Eating Disorders  
---Data---  
Feeding and eating disorders affect physical health and emotional well-being. Common disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa involves a distorted body image, leading individuals to perceive themselves as overweight. They may refuse to eat, exercise excessively, and adopt restrictive habits, potentially resulting in severe weight loss and life-threatening consequences. Bulimia nervosa involves cycles of binge-eating followed by purging through vomiting or misuse of laxatives. Affected individuals often feel shame during binges but experience relief after purging. Binge-eating disorder involves recurrent episodes of excessive food consumption without compensatory behaviors. Individuals eat rapidly, even when not hungry, and may continue until uncomfortably full.

---Title---  
Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders  
---Data---  
Substance-related and addictive disorders involve the maladaptive use of substances like alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. These substances disrupt social and occupational functioning and often lead to dependence and withdrawal. Heroin abuse causes respiratory depression, physical dependence, and severe withdrawal symptoms. Chronic use can result in life-threatening overdose. Cocaine abuse leads to cognitive impairments, social dysfunction, and dependence. Withdrawal symptoms include depression, fatigue, irritability, and anxiety. Chronic use poses serious risks to psychological and physical health.

---Title---
Nature of Learning
---Data---
Learning is a fundamental process in human behavior that involves changes resulting from experience. It is defined as "any relatively permanent change in behavior or behavioral potential produced by experience." Not all behavioral changes are considered learning; for instance, temporary changes caused by fatigue, drug use, or habituation are excluded. Only those changes that occur through practice and experience and are relatively permanent qualify as learning. This distinction is crucial in understanding how individuals acquire new skills and knowledge over time.

---Title---
Features of Learning
---Data---
Learning possesses distinct characteristics that separate it from other forms of behavioral change. At birth, humans exhibit only basic reflexive responses to environmental stimuli. As they grow and mature, their capacity to respond becomes more diverse through experiences such as identifying people, using tools like spoons, recognizing alphabets, and forming words. Learning also involves observing others and imitating their actions, as well as acquiring practical skills like driving and effective communication. Through learning, individuals become socially and professionally competent, enabling them to solve problems and adapt to various situations. This chapter explores the psychological aspects of learning, the methods by which learning occurs, empirical phenomena related to learning, and the factors influencing the speed and extent of learning, including learning disabilities.

---Title---
Temporary Behavioral Changes in Learning
---Data---
Not all behavioral changes qualify as learning. Some changes, such as those resulting from fatigue, habituation, or drug use, are temporary and not considered learning. For example, reading a psychology textbook or learning to drive may cause temporary fatigue, leading to a pause in activity. This is not learning but a transient behavioral change. Another example is habituation, where continuous exposure to stimuli, like the noise from a nearby wedding, initially causes distraction but eventually leads to reduced responsiveness. Additionally, behavioral changes induced by sedatives, drugs, or alcohol are temporary and fade as their effects wear off. These examples highlight how true learning involves lasting behavioral changes derived from experience.

---Title---
Learning as a Psychological Process
---Data---
Learning involves a sequence of psychological events that can be observed through controlled experiments. For instance, in a word-learning experiment, psychologists follow specific steps: conducting a pre-test to assess prior knowledge, presenting a list of words for a fixed time, allowing mental processing of the words, acquiring new knowledge, and finally, recalling the information after a period. By comparing the number of words remembered before and after the learning process, psychologists infer that learning has occurred. This process illustrates that learning is an inferred mental activity, distinct from observable behavior, which is termed performance.

---Title---
Learning Versus Performance
---Data---
Learning and performance are related but distinct concepts. Learning is the internal process of acquiring knowledge, while performance is the observable outcome or action that reflects what has been learned. For example, if a student memorizes a poem and successfully recites it when asked, the recitation is the performance. Based on the performance, the teacher infers that learning has taken place. This distinction emphasizes that while performance is visible, learning is an internal process that cannot be directly observed but must be inferred through actions.

---Title---
Paradigms of Learning
---Data---
Learning occurs in various ways, ranging from simple to complex responses. Different methods are used depending on the nature of the response being acquired. The most basic form of learning is called conditioning, which is divided into two types: classical conditioning and instrumental/operant conditioning. In addition to these, other forms of learning include observational learning, cognitive learning, verbal learning, and skill learning. Each paradigm of learning represents a distinct process through which individuals acquire, modify, and retain new behaviors and information. Understanding these paradigms is essential to grasp how humans and animals adapt to their environment.

---Title---
Classical Conditioning Learning
---Data---
Classical conditioning was first studied by Ivan P. Pavlov while researching the physiology of digestion. He observed that dogs began salivating at the sight of an empty food plate, prompting him to investigate this phenomenon systematically. In his experiment, a dog was placed in a controlled environment, and a simple surgery was performed to measure saliva. Pavlov repeatedly paired the sound of a bell (a neutral stimulus) with the presentation of food (an unconditioned stimulus). After several trials, the dog began salivating at the sound of the bell alone, even when no food was presented. This learned response was termed conditioning. In this process, the unconditioned stimulus (US) naturally triggers an unconditioned response (UR), while the previously neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) that elicits a conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning represents an S–S learning model where one stimulus signals the occurrence of another. This form of learning is not limited to laboratory settings and is prevalent in daily life. For example, seeing a sweet dish after a meal can trigger salivation, or a child may develop a fear of balloons after experiencing a loud burst, illustrating how environmental stimuli become associated with emotional and physiological responses.

---Title---
Determinants of Classical Conditioning Learning
---Data---
The speed and strength of response acquisition in classical conditioning depend on several factors. These factors determine how quickly and effectively a conditioned response (CR) is learned. One major factor is the time relation between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US). There are four primary procedures: simultaneous conditioning, where both stimuli are presented together; delayed conditioning, where the CS precedes the US and overlaps slightly; trace conditioning, where the CS ends before the US begins with a time gap in between; and backward conditioning, where the US is presented before the CS. Research indicates that delayed conditioning is the most effective method, while backward conditioning rarely results in learning. Another important factor is the type of unconditioned stimulus. Appetitive stimuli, which elicit positive responses like eating or caressing, generally require more acquisition trials. In contrast, aversive stimuli, such as loud noises or electric shocks, typically result in faster conditioning, often within a few trials. Lastly, the intensity of the conditioned stimulus also plays a critical role. More intense conditioned stimuli accelerate the learning process by reducing the number of trials needed to acquire a conditioned response. Understanding these determinants helps explain variations in how quickly and effectively individuals learn new associations through classical conditioning.

---Title---
Operant/Instrumental Conditioning Learning
---Data---
Operant conditioning was first investigated by B.F. Skinner, who studied the occurrence of voluntary responses when an organism interacts with its environment. Skinner called these responses "operants," which are behaviors emitted voluntarily and are under the organism's control. The term "operant" is used because the organism operates on the environment. Conditioning of operant behavior is known as operant conditioning. Skinner conducted his studies using specially designed chambers called "Skinner Boxes." In his experiment, a hungry rat was placed inside a box where it could move but not escape. The box contained a lever connected to a food dispenser. Initially, while exploring the box, the rat accidentally pressed the lever, causing a food pellet to drop. Over repeated trials, the rat learned to press the lever more quickly to obtain food. This behavior demonstrates that lever pressing is an operant response, and receiving food is its consequence. Since the rat's action was instrumental in obtaining food, this form of learning is also called instrumental conditioning. Examples of operant conditioning in daily life include children learning to locate hidden sweets, using polite language to gain favors, and operating mechanical devices. Through operant conditioning, humans and animals learn behaviors that help them achieve desired goals.

---Title---
Determinants of Operant Conditioning Learning
---Data---
Operant conditioning involves learning behaviors through their consequences, which are known as reinforcers. Reinforcers are stimuli or events that increase the likelihood of a behavior reoccurring. Several factors influence the course and strength of operant conditioning, including the type of reinforcement, the number and quality of reinforcement, and the schedule and timing of reinforcement.

---Title---
Types of Reinforcement
---Data---
Reinforcement may be positive or negative. Positive reinforcement involves stimuli with pleasant consequences that strengthen and maintain the responses that lead to them. Examples include food, water, praise, money, and status. Negative reinforcement involves unpleasant stimuli. Behaviors that help avoid or escape these stimuli are reinforced. For instance, people wear warm clothes to avoid the cold or use seat belts to avoid injury or fines. Unlike punishment, which suppresses behavior, negative reinforcement increases the probability of avoidance or escape responses. Although stronger punishment may suppress a behavior temporarily, it is not permanent and may lead to resentment toward the punisher.

---Title---
Number of Reinforcement and Other Features
---Data---
The number of reinforcements, the amount of reinforcement, and its quality all influence operant conditioning. More frequent and higher-quality reinforcement accelerates learning. For instance, giving better rewards like cake instead of bread leads to quicker learning. The amount of reinforcement also affects performance, as larger or more intense reinforcers enhance learning speed and retention.

---Title---
Schedules of Reinforcement
---Data---
Reinforcement can be continuous or intermittent (partial). Continuous reinforcement occurs when every correct response is reinforced, while intermittent reinforcement only reinforces some responses. Although continuous reinforcement speeds initial learning, partial reinforcement leads to greater resistance to extinction. This means behaviors learned under partial reinforcement persist longer even when reinforcement stops.

---Title---
Delayed Reinforcement
---Data---
The timing of reinforcement affects its effectiveness. Immediate reinforcement strengthens behavior more effectively than delayed reinforcement. For example, children prefer smaller rewards immediately rather than larger rewards after a delay, as immediate gratification is more reinforcing.

---Title---
Key Learning Processes in Operant Conditioning
---Data---
Learning in both classical and operant conditioning involves reinforcement, extinction, generalization, discrimination, and spontaneous recovery.

---Title---
Reinforcement
---Data---
Reinforcement strengthens behaviors. Primary reinforcers satisfy biological needs like food and water, while secondary reinforcers, such as money and praise, acquire their reinforcing properties through experience. Systematic use of reinforcers can shape desired behaviors by reinforcing successive approximations.

---Title---
Extinction
---Data---
Extinction occurs when a learned behavior disappears due to the absence of reinforcement. For example, if lever pressing no longer results in food, the rat will eventually stop pressing the lever. Learned behaviors show resistance to extinction based on the number, amount, and type of reinforcement during acquisition. Partial reinforcement during learning increases resistance to extinction.

---Title---
Generalisation and Discrimination
---Data---
Generalisation occurs when a learned response is elicited by stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus. For instance, a child who learns to find sweets in one jar may search other similar jars. Discrimination, on the other hand, is the ability to differentiate between similar stimuli and respond only to the specific one associated with reinforcement. Both processes play a critical role in shaping complex behaviors.

---Title---
Spontaneous Recovery
---Data---
Spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a previously extinguished response after some time has passed. This suggests that extinction does not permanently erase learned behaviors. The longer the time interval after extinction, the greater the likelihood of spontaneous recovery.

---Title---
Learned Helplessness
---Data---
Learned helplessness occurs when an organism is exposed to unavoidable negative stimuli and subsequently fails to escape or avoid similar situations. This phenomenon was demonstrated by Seligman and Maier, who subjected dogs to unavoidable shocks. Later, when the dogs had the opportunity to escape, they did not attempt to do so. This concept applies to humans as well, where repeated failure can lead to feelings of helplessness and contribute to conditions like depression. Persistent experiences of failure reduce motivation and performance, reinforcing a sense of helplessness.

---Title---
Observational Learning
---Data---
Observational learning occurs by observing and emulating the behavior of others. Previously referred to as imitation, this form of learning was extensively studied by Bandura and his colleagues through experimental research. Observational learning is also known as social learning because it helps individuals acquire social behaviors by watching others. In situations where people are unsure how to behave, they often observe and replicate the actions of others, a process called modeling. Examples are prevalent in daily life, such as fashion designers using models to showcase clothing. People observe these models through media and imitate their styles. Bandura's experiments highlight how observational learning is influenced by whether the model's behavior is rewarded or punished. In a famous study, children watched a film where a model displayed aggressive behavior toward a Bobo doll. Depending on whether the model was rewarded, punished, or received no consequence, the children's aggressive behavior varied accordingly. This indicates that while observers acquire knowledge through observation, their performance is shaped by the consequences observed. Children often mimic adults' behaviors through play, replicating social activities like marriage ceremonies and household roles. Through observational learning, children acquire social behaviors and personality traits such as aggressiveness, politeness, and diligence.

---Title---
Cognitive Learning
---Data---
Cognitive learning emphasizes the mental processes involved in learning rather than simple stimulus-response associations. This type of learning results in changes in knowledge rather than mere behavior. Two prominent forms of cognitive learning are insight learning and latent learning. Insight learning, as demonstrated by Kohler, involves the sudden realization of a solution to a problem. In his experiments, chimpanzees figured out how to use tools like boxes and poles to reach inaccessible food, not through trial and error, but through sudden insight. Insight learning reflects the learner's understanding of the relationship between means and ends, which can be applied to similar problems in the future. Latent learning, demonstrated by Tolman, involves learning that occurs without immediate evidence of it until reinforcement is provided. In Tolman's maze experiments, rats that initially received no reward still learned the maze layout. When later rewarded, these rats navigated the maze as efficiently as those previously reinforced. This indicates that learning can happen without visible behavioral change until an incentive is introduced. Latent learning suggests the formation of a cognitive map, a mental representation of spatial information, which remains hidden until needed.

---Title---
Verbal Learning
---Data---
Verbal learning refers to the acquisition of knowledge through words and is unique to human beings. This type of learning is studied using various experimental methods to understand how people associate and recall verbal information. Three primary methods of verbal learning are paired-associates learning, serial learning, and free recall. Paired-associates learning involves learning to associate two related items, such as a foreign word and its native language equivalent. The learner is shown stimulus-response pairs and is tested until they can recall the response upon seeing the stimulus. Serial learning requires participants to memorize and reproduce a list of items in a specific order, often using the serial anticipation method where one item prompts the recall of the next. Free recall involves presenting a list of words and asking participants to remember them in any order. Studies show that words at the beginning and end of the list are easier to recall than those in the middle. Several factors influence verbal learning, including list length, the meaningfulness of material, and organizational strategies. Meaningfulness is assessed through familiarity, associations, and frequency of usage. The total time principle states that the time required to learn material is constant, regardless of how trials are divided. Free recall often involves subjective and category-based organization, where participants naturally group related words during recall. Verbal learning can be both intentional and incidental, with learners noticing word features like rhymes and patterns without conscious effort.

---Title---
Nature of Skills
---Data---
A skill is defined as the ability to perform some complex task smoothly and efficiently. Examples of skills include car driving, airplane piloting, ship navigating, shorthand writing, and reading and writing. These skills are acquired through consistent practice and exercise. A skill involves a chain of perceptual motor responses or a sequence of stimulus-response (S-R) associations. Mastery of a skill requires continuous repetition and refinement until the performance becomes smooth and automatic.

---Title---
Phases of Skill Acquisition
---Data---
Skill learning occurs in several distinct phases, each characterized by qualitative changes in performance. With each attempt at learning a skill, the performance becomes more refined and less demanding in terms of conscious effort, eventually leading to spontaneous and automatic execution. During the transition from one phase to another, a temporary stagnation in performance known as the performance plateau may occur. Once the next phase begins, performance improves and advances to a higher level. Fitts' model of skill acquisition identifies three phases: cognitive, associative, and autonomous. In the cognitive phase, the learner focuses on understanding instructions and how to perform the task while keeping all external cues and outcomes in conscious awareness. The associative phase involves linking sensory inputs with corresponding responses, leading to reduced errors and improved performance with increased practice. In this phase, attention and concentration on the task remain essential. The autonomous phase is marked by a decrease in attentional demands and reduced interference from external factors, resulting in automatic and error-free performance. Practice is the key to progressing through these phases, reinforcing the adage that "practice makes a man perfect."

---Title---
Continuous vs Partial Reinforcement
---Data---
In learning experiments, reinforcement schedules play a crucial role in shaping behavior. Continuous reinforcement involves providing reinforcement after each target response, leading to a high rate of responding. However, once reinforcement is withheld, the acquired responses diminish quickly, and extinction occurs more easily. On the other hand, partial or intermittent reinforcement schedules involve reinforcing only some responses, making it harder for the learner to discern whether reinforcement has stopped or is merely delayed. This leads to a phenomenon known as the partial reinforcement effect, where responses acquired under partial reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than those under continuous reinforcement. Different types of intermittent schedules, such as ratio schedules, often produce high rates of responding and maintain learned behavior more effectively over time.

---Title---
Motivation
---Data---
Motivation is a fundamental factor that drives learning. It is both a mental and physiological state that energizes an organism to act toward fulfilling a particular need or goal. Motivated behavior persists until the goal is achieved and the need is satisfied. For example, a child searching for sweets in the kitchen learns the location of the jar through the act of foraging, while a hungry rat in a box learns to press a lever to obtain food. Motivation is essential for learning, as it directs and sustains effort. Human motivation for learning arises from two sources: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to engaging in learning activities for personal satisfaction and enjoyment, while extrinsic motivation involves learning to achieve external rewards or goals, such as passing exams with high grades. The stronger the motivation, the greater the effort and persistence in the learning process.

---Title---
Preparedness for Learning
---Data---
Preparedness for learning refers to the biological and cognitive readiness of an organism to acquire specific associations. Different species exhibit variations in sensory capacities, response abilities, and associative mechanisms, which influence their ability to learn. Certain types of learning are easier for organisms that are genetically equipped for those associations, while others may be difficult or even impossible. This concept is best understood as a continuum. At one end are tasks that are easily learned due to biological preparedness, while at the other end are tasks that are inherently difficult or impossible to learn. In the middle are tasks that can be learned with substantial effort and persistence. This biological constraint highlights that the ease of learning depends on the organism's innate associative mechanisms and genetic predisposition.

---Title---
Learning Disabilities
---Data---
You must have heard, observed, or read that thousands of children get enrolled for education in schools. Some of them, however, find the demands of the educational process too difficult to meet, and they drop out. Such students are called "drop-outs." The reasons for this are numerous, such as sensory impairment, intellectual disability, social and emotional disturbance, poor economic conditions of the family, cultural beliefs and norms, or other environmental influences. Apart from these conditions, there is another source of obstacle in the continuance of education that is called learning disabilities. It makes school learning, i.e., acquisition of knowledge and skills, too difficult to grapple with. Such children also fail to move forward in their learning activities.

---Title---
Definition of Learning Disabilities
---Data---
Learning disability is a general term. It refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested in terms of difficulty in the acquisition of learning, reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, and mathematical activities. The sources of such disorders are inherent in the child. It is presumed that these difficulties originate from problems with the functioning of the central nervous system. It may occur in conjunction with physical handicaps, sensory impairment, intellectual disability, or without them. It must be noted that learning disabilities may be observed as a distinct handicapping condition in children of average to superior intelligence, adequate sensory motor systems, and adequate learning opportunities. If it is not remedied, it may continue throughout life and affect self-esteem, vocation, social relations, and daily living activities.

---Title---
Symptoms of Learning Disabilities
---Data---
There are many symptoms of learning disabilities. They become manifest in different combinations in children who suffer from this disorder irrespective of their intelligence, motivation, and hard work for learning.

---Title---
Difficulties in Language Skills
---Data---
Children with learning disabilities often struggle with language-related tasks such as reading, writing, and speaking. They may have trouble writing letters and words correctly, reading aloud fluently, and expressing themselves clearly. Despite having normal hearing, they may also face challenges in processing and understanding spoken language.

---Title---
Attention Deficits and Hyperactivity
---Data---
Learning-disabled children often exhibit attention deficits, making it difficult for them to focus on a task for extended periods. They become easily distracted and may display hyperactivity, constantly moving and manipulating objects around them. This hyperactivity can further hinder their ability to concentrate on academic tasks.

---Title---
Spatial and Temporal Disorientation
---Data---
Such children commonly experience difficulties with spatial orientation and the concept of time. They may struggle to navigate new environments, lose their sense of direction, and misjudge left from right or up from down. Additionally, they may have an inadequate sense of time, leading to problems with punctuality and scheduling.

---Title---
Motor Coordination Difficulties
---Data---
Poor motor coordination and manual dexterity are common in children with learning disabilities. They may face challenges in tasks requiring fine motor skills, such as sharpening a pencil, using tools, or learning to ride a bicycle. This lack of coordination often makes even simple tasks more challenging.

---Title---
Inability to Follow Oral Instructions
---Data---
Children with learning disabilities often struggle to comprehend and execute oral directions. This difficulty can affect their performance in both academic and daily life tasks as they may misunderstand or forget multi-step instructions.

---Title---
Social Misjudgment
---Data---
Learning-disabled children frequently misjudge social relationships. They may struggle to interpret body language and social cues, leading to misunderstandings in their interactions with peers and adults. This difficulty often results in social isolation and challenges in forming and maintaining friendships.

---Title---
Perceptual Disorders
---Data---
Perceptual difficulties are common among learning-disabled children and may include visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic misperceptions. For instance, they may confuse similar-looking letters like 'b' and 'd' or misunderstand auditory signals like a doorbell versus a phone ring. This is not due to sensory deficits but rather the inability to interpret sensory input accurately.

---Title---
Dyslexia and Symbol Recognition Problems
---Data---
A significant number of learning-disabled children exhibit dyslexia, which affects their ability to recognize and organize symbols. They may confuse letters and words, such as mixing up 'was' with 'saw' or 'p' with 'q'. This leads to errors in reading, writing, and understanding written information.

---Title---
Memory and Information Retention Issues
---Data---
Children with learning disabilities often have difficulty retaining information. They may struggle with short-term memory tasks, such as recalling instructions or learning new concepts. This affects their ability to follow through with assignments and perform consistently in academic settings.

---Title---
Emotional and Behavioral Issues
---Data---
Frustration from academic struggles often leads to emotional and behavioral problems. Children with learning disabilities may experience anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression. These emotional issues can further impact their ability to concentrate and succeed in the classroom.

---Title---
Remedial Approaches for Learning Disabilities
---Data---
It must be noted that learning disabilities are not incurable. Remedial teaching methods go a long way in helping these children learn and become like other students. Educational psychologists have developed appropriate techniques, such as associative learning and cognitive training, to address most symptoms of learning disabilities. With early identification and tailored intervention, children with learning disabilities can overcome many of their challenges and lead successful academic and personal lives.

---Title---
Nature of Memory
---Data---
Memory refers to retaining and recalling information over a period of time, depending upon the nature of cognitive tasks you are required to perform. It might be necessary to hold information for a few seconds. For example, you use your memory to retain an unfamiliar telephone number until you have reached the telephone instrument to dial, or for many years you still remember the techniques of addition and subtraction which you perhaps learned during your early schooling. Memory is conceptualised as a process consisting of three independent, though interrelated stages. These are encoding, storage, and retrieval. Any information received by us necessarily goes through these stages.

---Title---
Encoding in memory
---Data---
Encoding is the first stage which refers to a process by which information is recorded and registered for the first time so that it becomes usable by our memory system. Whenever an external stimulus impinges on our sensory organs, it generates neural impulses. These impulses are received in different areas of our brain for further processing. During encoding, incoming information is received, and some meaning is derived from it. This information is then represented in a way so that it can be processed further.

---Title---
Storage in memory
---Data---
Storage is the second stage of memory. Information which has been encoded must also be stored so that it can be put to use later. Storage refers to the process through which information is retained and held over a period of time. Effective storage ensures that the information remains accessible when needed. Without proper storage, even well-encoded information can be lost or become difficult to retrieve.

---Title---
Retrieval in memory
---Data---
Retrieval is the third stage of memory. Information can be used only when one is able to recover it from memory. Retrieval refers to bringing the stored information to awareness so that it can be used for performing various cognitive tasks such as problem-solving or decision-making. Memory failure can occur at this stage if the information is not adequately stored or if the retrieval cues are insufficient to trigger the stored information.

---Title---
Factors Affecting Memory Stages
---Data---
Memory performance depends on how well each stage functions. Failure to encode information properly leads to weak memory traces. Poor storage reduces the likelihood of retaining information over time. Ineffective retrieval mechanisms can hinder access to the stored information even when it is available. Attention, repetition, meaningful association, and emotional significance all play a crucial role in enhancing the encoding, storage, and retrieval processes. For effective memory retention, it is vital to ensure robust encoding, sustained storage, and accurate retrieval.

---Title---
INFORMATION PROCESSING APPROACH: THE STAGE MODEL
---Data---
Initially, it was thought that memory is the capacity to store all information that we acquire through learning and experience. It was seen as a vast storehouse where all information that we knew was kept so that we could retrieve and use it as and when needed. But with the advent of the computer, human memory came to be seen as a system that processes information in the same way as a computer does. Both register, store, and manipulate large amounts of information and act on the basis of the outcome of such manipulations. If you have worked on a computer then you would know that it has a temporary memory (random access memory or RAM) and a permanent memory (e.g., a hard disk). Based on the program commands, the computer manipulates the contents of its memories and displays the output on the screen. Similarly, human beings register information, store and manipulate the stored information depending on the task they need to perform. For example, when you are required to solve a mathematical problem, the memory relating to mathematical operations, such as division or subtraction, is activated and put to use, and you receive the output (the problem solution). This analogy led to the development of the first model of memory, which was proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968. It is known as the Stage Model.

---Title---
MEMORY SYSTEMS: SENSORY, SHORT-TERM, AND LONG-TERM MEMORIES
---Data---
According to the Stage Model, there are three memory systems: the Sensory Memory, the Short-term Memory, and the Long-term Memory. Each of these systems has different features and performs different functions with respect to sensory inputs.

---Title---
Sensory Memory
---Data---
The incoming information first enters the sensory memory. Sensory memory has a large capacity but is of very short duration (less than a second). It registers information from each of the senses with reasonable accuracy and is often referred to as sensory registers. For instance, visual after-images (the trail of light after a bulb is switched off) or reverberations of a sound when it has ceased are examples of iconic (visual) or echoic (auditory) sensory registers.

---Title---
Short-term Memory (STM)
---Data---
Information that is attended to enters the short-term memory, which holds small amounts of information for a brief period (usually 30 seconds or less). Information in STM is primarily encoded acoustically. Unless rehearsed continuously, it may get lost in less than 30 seconds. STM is fragile but not as fragile as sensory registers, where information decays automatically in less than a second.

---Title---
Long-term Memory (LTM)
---Data---
Information that survives the capacity and duration limitations of the STM enters the long-term memory, which has a vast and permanent capacity. Information in LTM is encoded semantically, meaning it is stored based on meaning. Once any information enters LTM, it is never truly forgotten; what appears as forgetting is often a retrieval failure where stored information cannot be accessed.

---Title---
Control Processes in Memory
---Data---
Information travels between memory stores through control processes. Selective attention is the first control process that decides what information moves from sensory memory to STM. Maintenance rehearsal helps retain information in STM through silent or vocal repetition. Chunking is another control process that expands STM capacity by grouping information into meaningful chunks. Information moves to LTM through elaborative rehearsal, which connects new information to already existing knowledge and enhances retention.

---Title---
Evidence for and Against the Stage Model
---Data---
Experiments supporting the stage model show STM and LTM as separate stores. However, cases like KF, who had impaired STM but intact LTM, challenge this distinction. Moreover, while the model suggests STM encodes acoustically and LTM semantically, studies show both forms of encoding occur in each memory system. Such findings led to alternative models like the Levels of Processing model.

---Title---
LEVELS OF PROCESSING
---Data---
The Levels of Processing view, proposed by Craik and Lockhart in 1972, suggests that memory retention depends on how deeply information is processed. Information can be analyzed at three levels: shallow (physical features), intermediate (phonetic sounds), and deep (semantic meaning). Deeper levels of processing result in stronger, more durable memories.

---Title---
Shallow Processing
---Data---
Shallow processing involves analyzing information based on physical or structural features. For example, focusing on the shape of letters in a word without considering their meaning leads to fragile memories that decay quickly.

---Title---
Intermediate Processing
---Data---
At the intermediate level, information is processed phonetically by attending to the sounds of the letters. Although this provides more durable memory than shallow processing, it is still prone to forgetting.

---Title---
Deep Processing
---Data---
Deep processing involves encoding information based on its meaning. For example, understanding a word like "cat" as a furry, four-legged mammal with personal associations leads to longer-lasting memory. This level of processing enhances long-term retention and reduces forgetting.

---Title---
Implications for Learning
---Data---
The Levels of Processing model suggests that to enhance memory retention, learners should focus on understanding and elaborating on the meaning of new information. Connecting new material to existing knowledge and real-life experiences improves long-term recall and learning outcomes.

---Title---
Declarative and Procedural Memory
---Data---
Long-term memory is not a single, unified system but consists of different types of memory that store various kinds of information. One major classification within long-term memory is between Declarative Memory and Procedural Memory. Declarative Memory refers to memories of facts and events that can be consciously recalled and described verbally. Examples include remembering that India became independent on August 15, 1947, or that a frog is an amphibian. This type of memory is explicit and easily articulated. Procedural Memory, on the other hand, involves memories related to skills and tasks. It includes knowing how to do things, such as riding a bicycle or playing basketball. Unlike declarative memory, procedural memory is implicit and not easily described in words. For instance, while you can explain the rules of cricket, describing exactly how you ride a bicycle is much harder.

---Title---
Episodic Memory
---Data---
Episodic Memory is a subdivision of declarative memory that contains the biographical details of our lives. It stores information about personal experiences and specific events, often with an emotional component. For example, remembering how you felt when you stood first in class or recalling a conversation with a friend after an argument involves episodic memory. This type of memory is often vivid but is also selective. While some personal experiences are easily remembered, others may fade over time. Additionally, pleasant experiences are generally remembered more vividly than painful or unpleasant ones.

---Title---
Semantic Memory
---Data---
Semantic Memory is another subdivision of declarative memory that contains general knowledge and facts about the world. This includes information like the meaning of concepts, mathematical rules, and factual knowledge. For example, knowing that 2 + 6 = 8, that Bangalore is the capital of Karnataka, or that the word "elephant" is misspelled falls under semantic memory. Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory is not tied to specific personal experiences and is affect-neutral. People typically do not remember when or where they learned these facts, but the knowledge itself remains relatively stable and is less susceptible to forgetting.

---Title---
Methods of Memory Measurement
---Data---
There are many ways in which memory is measured experimentally. Since there are many kinds of memories, any method appropriate for studying one type of memory may not be suited for studying another. The major methods which are used for memory measurement are being presented here.

---Title---
Free Recall and Recognition (for measuring facts/episodes related memory)
---Data---
In free recall method, participants are presented with some words which they are asked to memorise and after some time they are asked to recall them in any order. The more they are able to recall, the better their memory is. In recognition, instead of being asked to generate items, participants see the items that they had memorised along with distracter items (those that they had not seen) and their task is to recognise which one of those they had learnt. The greater the number of recognition of 'old items', better is the memory.

---Title---
Sentence Verification Task (for measuring semantic memory)
---Data---
Semantic memory is not amenable to any forgetting because it embodies general knowledge that we all possess. In sentence verification task, the participants are asked to indicate whether the given sentences are true or false. Faster the participants respond, better retained is the information needed to verify those sentences.

---Title---
Priming (for measuring information we cannot report verbally)
---Data---
We store many kinds of information that we cannot report verbally - for instance, information necessary to ride a bicycle or play a sitar. Besides, we also store information that we are not aware of, which is described as implicit memory. In priming method, participants are shown a list of words, such as garden, playground, house, etc. and then they are shown parts of these words like gar, pla, ho, along with parts of other words they had not seen. Participants complete parts of seen words more quickly than parts of words they had not seen. When asked, they are often unaware of this and report that they have only guessed.

---Title---
Nature and Causes of Forgetting
---Data---
Each one of us has experienced forgetting and its consequences almost routinely. Why do we forget? Is it because the information we commit to our long-term memory is somehow lost? Is it because we did not memorise it well enough? Is it because we did not encode the information correctly or is it because during storage, it got distorted or misplaced? Many theories have been forwarded to explain forgetting and now you will read about those that seem plausible and have received considerable attention.

---Title---
Forgetting due to Trace Decay
---Data---
Trace decay (also called disuse theory) is the earliest theory of forgetting. The assumption here is that memory leads to modification in the central nervous system, which is akin to physical changes in the brain called memory traces. When these memory traces are not used for a long time, they simply fade away and become unavailable. This theory has been proved inadequate on several grounds. If forgetting takes place because memory traces decay due to disuse, then people who go to sleep after memorising should forget more compared to those who remain awake, simply because there is no way in which memory traces can be put to use during sleep. Results, however, show just the opposite. Those who remain awake after memorising (waking condition) show greater forgetting than those who sleep (sleeping condition).

---Title---
Forgetting due to Interference
---Data---
If forgetting is not due to trace decay then why does it take place? A theory of forgetting that has perhaps been the most influential one is the interference theory which suggests that forgetting is due to interference between various information that the memory store contains. This theory assumes that learning and memorising involve forming of associations between items and once acquired, these associations remain intact in the memory. People keep acquiring numerous such associations and each of these rests independently without any mutual conflict. However, interference comes about at a time of retrieval when these various sets of associations compete with each other for retrieval. There are at least two kinds of interferences that may result in forgetting. Interference can be proactive (forward moving) which means what you have learnt earlier interferes with the recall of your subsequent learning or retroactive (backward moving) which refers to difficulty in recalling what you have learnt earlier because of learning new material.

---Title---
Forgetting due to Retrieval Failure
---Data---
Forgetting can occur not only because the memory traces have decayed over time (as suggested by the disuse theory) or because independent sets of stored associations compete at the time of recall (as suggested by the interference theory) but also because at the time of recall, either the retrieval cues are absent or they are inappropriate. Retrieval cues are aids which help us in recovering information stored in the memory. This view was advanced by Tulving and his associates who carried out several experiments to show that contents of memory may become inaccessible either due to absence or inappropriateness of retrieval cues that are available/employed at the time of recall. Besides category names, the physical context in which you learn also provides effective retrieval cues. Some individuals undergo experiences that are traumatic. A traumatic experience emotionally hurts a person. Sigmund Freud posited that such experiences are repressed into the unconscious and are not available for retrieval from memory. In some persons, traumatic experiences may give rise to psychological amnesia which may result in a disorder known as 'fugue state' where a person assumes a new identity and one personality knows nothing about the other.

---Title---
Enhancing Memory
---Data---
All of us desire to possess an excellent memory system that is robust and dependable. Who, after all, likes to face situations of memory failures that lead to so much of anxiety and embarrassment? After learning about various memory-related processes, you certainly would like to know how your memory can be improved. There are a number of strategies for improving memory called mnemonics (pronounced ni-mo-nicks) to help you improve your memory. Some of these mnemonics involve the use of images whereas others emphasise self-induced organisation of learned information. You will now read about mnemonics and some suggestions given for memory improvement.

---Title---
Mnemonics Using Images to Enhance Memory
---Data---
Mnemonics using images require that you create vivid and interacting images of and around the material you wish to remember. The two prominent mnemonic devices, which make interesting use of images, are the keyword method and the method of loci.

---Title---
The Keyword Method for Learning Foreign Words
---Data---
Suppose you want to learn words of any foreign language. In the keyword method, an English word (the assumption here is that you know the English language) that sounds similar to the word of a foreign language is identified. This English word will function as the keyword. For example, if you want to remember the Spanish word for duck which is 'Pato', you may choose 'pot' as the keyword and then evoke images of the keyword and the target word (the Spanish word you want to remember) and imagine them as interacting. You might, in this case, imagine a duck in a pot full of water. This method of learning words of a foreign language is much superior compared to any kind of rote memorisation.

---Title---
The Method of Loci for Serial Recall
---Data---
In order to use the method of loci, items you want to remember are placed as objects arranged in a physical space in the form of visual images. This method is particularly helpful in remembering items in a serial order. It requires that you first visualise objects/places that you know well in a specific sequence, imagine the objects you want to remember and associate them one by one to the physical locations. For example, suppose you want to remember bread, eggs, tomatoes, and soap on your way to the market, you may visualise a loaf of bread and eggs placed in your kitchen, tomatoes kept on a table and soap in the bathroom. When you enter the market all you need to do is to take a mental walk along the route from your kitchen to the bathroom recalling all the items of your shopping list in a sequence.

---Title---
Mnemonics Using Organisation to Improve Memory
---Data---
Organisation refers to imposing a certain order on the material you want to remember. Mnemonics of this kind are helpful because the framework you create while organising makes the retrieval task fairly easy.

---Title---
Chunking to Enhance Short-Term Memory
---Data---
While describing the features of short-term memory, we noted how chunking can increase the capacity of short-term memory. In chunking, several smaller units are combined to form large chunks. For creating chunks, it is important to discover some organisational principles, which can link smaller units. Therefore, apart from being a control mechanism to increase the capacity of short-term memory, chunking can be used to improve memory as well.

---Title---
First Letter Technique for Easy Recall
---Data---
In order to employ the first letter technique, you need to pick up the first letter of each word you want to remember and arrange them to form another word or a sentence. For example, the colours of a rainbow are remembered in this way (VIBGYOR- that stands for Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red).

---Title---
Comprehensive Approach to Memory Improvement
---Data---
Mnemonic strategies for memory enhancement are too simplistic and perhaps underestimate the complexities of memory tasks and the difficulties people experience while memorising. In place of mnemonics, a more comprehensive approach to memory improvement has been suggested by many psychologists. In such an approach, emphasis is laid on applying knowledge about memory processes to the task of memory improvement.

---Title---
Engage in Deep Level Processing for Better Memory
---Data---
If you want to memorise any information well, engage in deep-level processing. Craik and Lockhart have demonstrated that processing information in terms of the meaning that they convey leads to better memory as compared to attending to their surface features. Deep processing would involve asking as many questions related to the information as possible, considering its meaning, and examining its relationships to the facts you already know. In this way, the new information will become a part of your existing knowledge framework and the chances that it will be remembered are increased.

---Title---
Minimise Interference to Improve Retention
---Data---
Interference, as we have read, is a major cause of forgetting and therefore you should try to avoid it as much as possible. You know that maximum interference is caused when very similar materials are learned in a sequence. Avoid this. Arrange your study in such a way that you do not learn similar subjects one after the other. Instead, pick up some other subject unrelated to the previous one. If that is not possible, distribute your learning/practice. This means giving yourself intermittent rest periods while studying to minimise interference.

---Title---
Use Retrieval Cues for Easier Recall
---Data---
While you learn something, think of retrieval cues inherent in your study material. Identify them and link parts of the study material to these cues. Cues will be easier to remember compared to the entire content and the links you have created between cues and the content will facilitate the retrieval process.

---Title---
PQRST Method for Effective Study
---Data---
Thomas and Robinson have developed another strategy to help students in remembering more which they called the methods of PQRST. This acronym stands for Preview, Question, Read, Self-recitation, and Test. Preview refers to giving a cursory look at the chapter and familiarising oneself with its contents. Question means raising questions and seeking answers from the lesson. Now start reading and look for answers to questions you had raised. After reading, try to rewrite what you have read and at the end test how much you have been able to understand.

---Title---
Final Note on Memory Improvement
---Data---
At the end, a note of caution must be sounded. There is no one method that can solve all problems related to retention and bring about overnight memory improvement. In order to improve your memory, you need to attend to a wide variety of factors that affect your memory such as your health status, your interest and motivation, your familiarity with the subject matter, and so on. In addition, you must learn to use strategies for memory improvement depending upon the nature of memory tasks you are required to accomplish.

Nature of Thinking
---Data---
Thinking is the base of all cognitive activities or processes and is unique to human beings. It involves manipulation and analysis of information received from the environment. For example, while seeing a painting, you are not simply focusing on the colour of the painting or the lines and strokes, rather you are going beyond the given text in interpreting its meaning and you are trying to relate the information to your existing knowledge. Understanding of the painting involves creation of new meaning that is added to your knowledge. Thinking, therefore, is a higher mental process through which we manipulate and analyse the acquired or existing information. Such manipulation and analysis occur by means of abstracting, reasoning, imagining, problem solving, judging, and decision-making. Thinking is mostly organised and goal directed. All day-to-day activities, ranging from cooking to solving a math problem, have a goal. One desires to reach the goal by planning, recalling the steps that one has already followed in the past if the task is familiar or inferring strategies if the task is new. Thinking is an internal mental process, which can be inferred from overt behaviour. If you see a chess player engrossed in thinking for several minutes before making a move, you cannot observe what he is thinking. You can simply infer what he was thinking or what strategies he was trying to evaluate, from his next move.

---Title---
Building Blocks of Thought
---Data---
We already know that thinking relies on knowledge we already possess. Such knowledge is represented either in the form of mental images or words. People usually think by means of mental images or words. Suppose you are travelling by road to reach a place, which you had visited long back. You would try to use the visual representation of the street and other places. On the other hand, when you want to buy a storybook your choice would depend upon your knowledge about different authors, themes, etc. Here, your thinking is based on words or concepts. We shall first discuss mental image and then move on to concepts as the base of human thought.

---Title---
Mental Image
---Data---
Suppose, I ask you to imagine a cat sitting on a tree with its tail slightly raised and curved. You would most likely try to form a visual image of the whole situation, something similar to what the girl in the picture is doing. Or think of another situation where you are asked to imagine yourself standing in front of the Taj Mahal and describe what you see. While doing this you are actually forming a visual image of the event. You are probably trying to see through your mind's eye, just like the way you would see a picture. Why is it useful to draw a map while giving directions to someone? Try to remember your earlier experience in reading a map, remembering the different places and subsequently locating them in a physical map in your examination. In doing this, you were mostly forming and using mental images. An image is a mental representation of a sensory experience; it can be used to think about things, places, and events.

---Title---
Concepts
---Data---
Whenever we come across an object or event familiar or unfamiliar, we try to identify the object or event by extracting its characteristics, matching it with the already existing category of objects and events. For example, when we see an apple, we categorise it as fruit, when we see a table we categorise it as furniture, when we see a dog we categorise it as an animal, and so on. When we see a new object, we try to look for its characteristics, match them with characteristics of an existing category, and if matching is perfect we give it the name of that category. For example, while walking on the road you come across an unfamiliar quadruped of a very small size, with a face like a dog, wagging its tail and barking at strangers. You would no doubt identify it as a dog and probably think that it is of a new breed, which you have never seen before. You would also conclude that it would bite strangers. A concept thus, is a mental representation of a category. It refers to a class of objects, ideas or events that share common properties.

---Title---
Why Do We Need to Form Concepts?
---Data---
Concept formation helps us in organising our knowledge so that whenever we need to access our knowledge, we can do it with less time and effort. It is something similar to what we do to organise our things at home. Children who are very systematic and organised, put their things such as books, notebooks, pen, pencil, and other accessories in specific places in their cupboard, so that in the morning, they don't have to struggle to find a particular book or the geometry box. In the library too you have seen books organised as per subject areas and labelled so that you would be able to find them quickly with less effort. Thus, for making our thought process quick and efficient, we form concepts and categorise objects and events.

---Title---  
The Influence of Culture on Thinking  
---Data---  
Our beliefs, values, and social practices shape the way we think. A study comparing American and Asian students revealed cultural differences in perception. When shown an underwater scene, American students focused on the most prominent features, such as a large fish swimming to the right. In contrast, Japanese students described the background, mentioning details like a rocky bottom or green water. These findings suggest that Americans engage in analytical thinking, which involves focusing on individual objects separately, while Asians (including Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans) practice holistic thinking, emphasizing the relationship between objects and their surroundings. This cultural influence on thinking patterns highlights how different societies perceive and interpret the world in unique ways.  

---Title---  
Understanding Problem Solving  
---Data---  
Problem solving is a goal-directed form of thinking that involves finding solutions to various challenges, from simple tasks to complex issues. Whether repairing a broken bicycle, planning a summer trip, or mending a friendship, the process involves moving from an initial state (the problem) to a desired end state (the solution) through a series of mental operations. Some problems can be solved quickly using immediate cues, while others require more time and effort. Even everyday activities, such as preparing a snack for a visiting friend, can be considered problem-solving tasks. The process involves identifying the problem, devising potential solutions, and executing the most effective approach to achieve the goal.  

---Title---  
Obstacles to Problem Solving  
---Data---  
Two primary obstacles to effective problem solving are mental set and lack of motivation. Mental set refers to the tendency to rely on previously successful strategies to solve new problems. While this approach can be helpful, it may also create rigidity, preventing the exploration of new methods. For example, while solving mathematical problems, a person might stick to familiar steps even when they fail to work. Another obstacle, functional fixedness, occurs when people are unable to see alternative uses for an object. Overcoming these mental rigidities is crucial for creative problem-solving. Additionally, motivation plays a vital role in finding solutions. Without persistence, even individuals with exceptional problem-solving skills may give up easily when faced with challenges. Maintaining the drive to continue searching for solutions is essential for overcoming difficult problems.  

---Title---  
Mental Operations in Problem Solving  
---Data---  
Successful problem solving involves a sequence of mental operations that guide the process. For instance, organizing a play for Teachers' Day requires several steps. The first step is identifying the problem, such as recognizing the limited time available to prepare. Next is representing the problem by listing necessary tasks like choosing a theme, selecting actors, and arranging resources. Planning a solution involves researching themes, consulting experts, and setting sub-goals. Evaluating all possible solutions helps in comparing options through rehearsals and discussions. Once the best solution is chosen, it is executed and assessed for effectiveness. If the play is successful, the steps can be documented for future reference. This structured approach allows for thoughtful planning, execution, and reflection, enhancing problem-solving capabilities.

---Title---  
Understanding Reasoning  
---Data---  
Reasoning is the cognitive process of gathering and analyzing information to arrive at conclusions. It helps us interpret situations and draw logical inferences. For example, if you see someone running on a railway platform, you might conclude that they are trying to catch a departing train, see off a friend, or retrieve a forgotten item. Reasoning can be categorized into two main types: deductive and inductive. Both methods allow us to make sense of the world by using available information and applying logical processes. Reasoning is also closely connected to problem-solving, as it helps us evaluate information and identify solutions based on our observations and experiences.  

---Title---  
Deductive and Inductive Reasoning  
---Data---  
Deductive reasoning involves starting with a general assumption and drawing specific conclusions from it. For instance, if you believe that people only run on railway platforms when they are late, you would deduce that a person running on the platform is trying to catch a train. This type of reasoning moves from general to particular. However, it carries the risk of invalid conclusions if the initial assumption is incorrect. On the other hand, inductive reasoning is based on specific observations leading to a general conclusion. For example, if you observe someone retrieving a bag from a train, you might conclude that they had left it behind. Although inductive reasoning is common in scientific research and everyday decision-making, it can lead to errors when conclusions are drawn without sufficient evidence. Both types of reasoning are essential for analyzing situations and making informed judgments.  

---Title---  
Analogy in Reasoning  
---Data---  
Analogy is another form of reasoning that draws comparisons between two sets of relationships. It follows the structure "A is to B as C is to D." For example, "water is to fish as air is to humans" illustrates how living beings rely on their respective environments. Analogies are useful in problem-solving because they highlight key attributes and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed. By recognizing patterns and similarities, analogical reasoning aids in understanding unfamiliar concepts and applying known information to new situations. This cognitive tool is widely used in educational contexts, scientific research, and everyday thinking to simplify complex ideas and foster creative solutions.  

---Title---  
Understanding Decision-Making  
---Data---  
Decision-making is the process of selecting the best option from multiple alternatives based on an evaluation of their costs and benefits. It is closely related to reasoning and judgment, as both involve drawing conclusions and making choices. Some decisions, such as applying brakes at a red light, are automatic and require little conscious effort. Others, like evaluating a literary text or choosing a career path, demand careful analysis and reflection. Personal beliefs, attitudes, and newly acquired information often influence our decisions. For example, students may initially judge a new teacher as strict but later revise their opinion after interacting with them. Decision-making involves weighing personal significance, future outcomes, and available resources to make informed choices.  

---Title---  
Decision-Making in Real-Life Situations  
---Data---  
In real-life situations, decision-making requires balancing multiple factors and often occurs under time constraints. For example, choosing between psychology and economics as subjects involves considering interest, career prospects, and the quality of instruction. Consulting seniors, attending classes, and researching future opportunities can help inform this decision. Similarly, a student excelling in badminton must decide between practicing for a state-level competition or preparing for final exams. This decision depends on evaluating the potential outcomes and personal priorities. People differ in their decision-making approaches due to variations in values and preferences. While some decisions require thorough analysis, others are made quickly based on instinct and previous experiences. Effective decision-making involves assessing all available information and considering both short-term and long-term consequences.

Nature and Process of Creative Thinking
---Data---
You might have wondered at times how someone for the first time thought of acts like planting a seed, or devising a wheel, or decorating the walls of caves with drawings, etc. Perhaps not satisfied with the old ways of carrying out day-to-day activities, such persons thought of something original. There are countless others whose creativity has led to the present-day scientific and technological progress that we now enjoy. Music, painting, poetry, and other forms of art that give us pleasure and joy, are all products of creative thinking. You might have heard about A.D. Karve, a botanist from our country, who got the UK's top energy award for devising a smokeless 'Chullah'. He converted dry, useless sugarcane leaves into clean fuel. You might have also heard of Class XI student Ashish Panwar, who won a bronze medal for assembling a five feet tall robot at the First International Robotics Olympiad held at Glasgow. These are only a few examples of creativity. Try to think of some other examples of creativity in different fields. It is important to remember that creative thinking is not always expressed in extraordinary work. One does not have to be a scientist or an artist to be a creative thinker. Everyone has the potential to be creative. Creative thinking can be applied in almost any area of human activity at different levels. It could be reflected in activities like writing, teaching, cooking, enacting roles, storytelling, conversation, dialogues, asking questions, playing games, trying to solve day-to-day problems, organizing activities, helping others resolve conflicts, and so on. This concept of 'Everyday Creativity', which is reflected in one's way of perceiving thinking and problem-solving, is different from the 'special talent creativity' seen in outstanding creative achievements.

---Title---
Nature of Creative Thinking
---Data---
Creative thinking is distinguished from other types of thinking by the fact that it involves the production of novel and original ideas or solutions to problems. Sometimes, creative thinking is understood just as a new way of thinking or thinking differently. However, it is important to know that, besides novelty, originality is also an important characteristic of creative thinking. Every year new models of household appliances, tape-recorders, cars, scooters, and television sets produced may not be original unless unique features are added to these products. Creative thinking thus refers to originality and uniqueness of ideas or solutions that did not previously exist. Creative thinking is also generally characterized by what Bruner calls "effective surprise". If the product or idea is unusual, the response of most who experience it is one of instant surprise or of being startled. Another important criterion that characterizes creative thinking is its appropriateness in a particular context. Simply thinking of being different without any purpose, doing things in one's own ways, being non-conformist, indulging in fantasy without any purpose or coming out with a bizarre idea, is at times mistaken for creative thinking. Researchers tend to agree that thinking is said to be creative when it is reality-oriented, appropriate, constructive, and socially desirable.

---Title---
Convergent and Divergent Thinking
---Data---
J.P. Guilford, a pioneer in creativity research, proposed two types of thinking: convergent and divergent. Convergent thinking refers to thinking that is required to solve problems which have only one correct answer. The mind converges to the correct solution. To illustrate, look at the question given below. It is based on a number series, where you have to find the next number. Only one right answer is expected. For example, in the sequence "3, 6, 9...", the next number is "12". Now you try to think of certain questions for which there is no one right answer but many answers. A few such questions are given below: What are the various uses of cloth? What improvements will you suggest in a chair so that it becomes more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing? What will happen if examinations are abolished in schools? Answers to these questions require divergent thinking which is an open-ended thinking where the individual can think of different answers to the questions or problems in terms of her/his experiences. Such kind of thinking helps in producing novel and original ideas. Divergent thinking abilities generally include fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. Fluency is the ability to produce many ideas for a given task or problem. The more ideas a person produces, the higher their fluency ability. Flexibility indicates variety in thinking. It may be thinking of different uses of an object, or different interpretations of a picture or story, or different ways of solving a problem. Originality is the ability to produce ideas that are rare or unusual by seeing new relationships, combining old ideas with new ones, and looking at things from different perspectives. Research has shown that fluency and flexibility are necessary conditions for originality. Elaboration is the ability to go into details and work out the implications of new ideas. Divergent thinking abilities facilitate the generation of a variety of ideas which may not seem to be related. You must remember that both convergent and divergent thinking are important for creative thinking. Divergent thinking is essential in generating a wide range of ideas. Convergent thinking is important to identify the most useful or appropriate idea.

---Title---
Lateral Thinking
---Data---
Edward de Bono has used the term 'lateral thinking' to describe what Guilford termed as divergent thinking. He makes a distinction between vertical thinking and lateral thinking. Vertical thinking involves mental operations that move in a straight line back and forth between lower and higher-level concepts whereas lateral thinking involves looking for alternative ways of defining and interpreting problems. He states "vertical (logical) thinking digs the same hole deeper, i.e. thinking deeper in the same direction; lateral thinking is concerned with digging a hole in another place". De Bono suggests that lateral thinking can help make mental leaps and is likely to create a number of ways of thinking. De Bono developed the 'Six Thinking Hats' technique to stimulate different modes of thinking. One can put on or take off these hats according to the type of thinking required. The white hat means gathering information, facts, and figures, and filling gaps in information. The red hat covers the expression of feelings and emotions on the subject. The black hat represents judgment, caution, and logic. The yellow hat covers thinking on what will work and why it will be beneficial. The green hat is for creativity, alternatives, and changes. The blue hat represents thinking about the process and not the ideas as such. The 'Six Thinking Hats' reflect different perspectives from which an issue or problem is viewed. The technique can be used individually as well as in groups.

Introduction to Thought and Language
---Data---
Till now, we have discussed the nature and meaning of thinking and how thinking is based on images and concepts. We have also discussed the various processes of thought. Throughout the discussion did you feel that words or language are essential to express what we think? This section examines the relationship between language and thought: that language determines thought, that thought determines language, and that thought and language have different origins. Let us examine these three viewpoints in some detail.

---Title---
Language as Determinant of Thought
---Data---
In Hindi and other Indian languages, we use a number of different words for various kinship relationships. We have different terms for mother’s brother, father’s elder brother, father’s younger brother, mother’s sister’s husband, father’s sister’s husband, and so on. An English person uses just one word, uncle, to describe all these kinship relationships. In the English language, there are dozens of words for colours whereas some tribal languages have only two to four colour terms. Do such differences matter for how we think? Does an Indian child find it easier to think about and differentiate between various kinship relationships compared to her English-speaking counterpart? Does our thinking process depend on how we describe it in our language? Benjamin Lee Whorf was of the view that language determines the contents of thought. This view is known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis. In its strong version, this hypothesis holds that what and how individuals can possibly think is determined by the language and linguistic categories they use (linguistic determinism). Experimental evidence, however, maintains that it is possible to have the same level or quality of thoughts in all languages depending upon the availability of linguistic categories and structures. Some thoughts may be easier in one language compared to another.

---Title---
Thought as Determinant of Language
---Data---
The noted Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget, believed that thought not only determines language but also precedes it. Piaget argued that children form an internal representation of the world through thinking. For example, when children see something and later copy it (a process called imitation), thinking does take place, which does not involve language. A child’s observation of others' behaviour and imitation of the same behaviour, no doubt involves thinking but not language. Language is just one of the vehicles of thinking. As actions become internalised, language may affect children’s range of symbolic thinking but is not necessary for the origins of thought. Piaget believed that though language can be taught to children, understanding of the words requires knowledge of the underlying concepts (i.e., thinking). Thus, thought is basic and necessary if language is to be understood.

---Title---
Different Origins of Language and Thought
---Data---
The Russian psychologist, Lev Vyogotsky, argued that thoughts and language develop in a child separately until about two years of age, when they merge. Before two years, thought is preverbal and is experienced more in action (Piaget’s sensory motor stage). The child’s utterances are more automatic reflexes - crying when uncomfortable - than thought-based. Around two years of age, the child expresses thought verbally, and her/his speech reflects rationality. Now children are able to manipulate thoughts using soundless speech. He believed that during this period, the development of language and thinking become interdependent; the development of conceptual thinking depends upon the quality of inner speech and vice versa. Thought is used without language when the vehicle of thinking is non-verbal, such as visual or movement-related. Language is used without thought when expressing feelings or exchanging pleasantries, for example, “Good morning! How are you?” “Very well, I am fine.” When the two functions overlap, they can be used together to produce verbal thought and rational speech.

---Title---
Meaning and Nature of Language
---Data---
In the previous section we discussed the relationship between language and thought. In this section, we will examine how human beings acquire and use language in different age groups. Think for a moment: what would have happened if you did not have a language to express whatever you wanted to say? In the absence of language you will not be able to communicate your ideas and feelings, nor will you have the opportunity to know or have access to what others think and feel. As a child when you first started saying “ma..ma..ma.”, it not only gave you tremendous boost to continue repeating this activity but also was a great moment of joy for your parents and other care-givers. Slowly you learnt to say ‘ma’ and ‘papa’ and sometime later combined two or more words to communicate your needs, feelings, and thoughts. You learnt words appropriate for situations and also learnt the rules of putting these words in sentences. Initially you learnt to communicate in the language being used at home (usually the mother-tongue), went to school and learnt the formal language of instruction (in many cases this language is different from the mother-tongue), and were promoted to higher grades and learnt other languages. If you look back, you will realise that your journey from crying and saying “ma..ma..ma” to the attainment of mastery in not one but many languages, has been a fascinating one. In this section we shall be discussing the salient features of language acquisition.

---Title---
Characteristics of Language
---Data---
You have been using language all your life. Now try to define accurately what it is that you have been using. Language consists of a system of symbols organised by means of certain rules that we use to communicate with each other. You will notice that language has three basic characteristics: (a) the presence of symbols, (b) a set of rules to organise these symbols, and (c) communication. Here we shall be discussing these three characteristics of language. The first characteristic of language is that it involves symbols. Symbols represent something or someone else, for example, the place where you live is called ‘home’, the place where you study is called ‘school’, the thing that you eat is called ‘food’. Words like home, school, food, and numerous other words do not in themselves carry any meaning. When these words are associated with some objects/events they attain meaning and we begin recognising those objects/events, etc. with particular words (symbols). We use symbols while thinking. The second characteristic of language is that it involves rules. While combining two or more words we usually follow a definite and accepted order of presenting these words. For example, one would most likely say “I am going to school” and not “school am going I”. The third characteristic of language is that it is used for communicating one’s thought, ideas, intentions, and feelings to others. On many occasions we communicate through the use of our body parts, called gestures or postures. This type of communication is called non-verbal communication. Some people who cannot use oral speech, like the ones with severe hearing and speech problems, communicate through signs. Sign language is also a form of language.

---Title---
Development of Language
---Data---
Language is a complex system and unique to human beings. Psychologists have tried to teach sign language, use of symbols to chimpanzees, dolphins, parrots, etc. But it is observed that, human language is more complex, creative, and spontaneous than the system of communication other animals can learn. There is also a great deal of regularity with which children all over the world seem to be learning the language or languages to which they are exposed. When you compare individual children, you find that they differ a great deal in the rate of their language development as well as in how they go about it. But when you take a general view of children’s acquisition of language all over the world you find some predictable pattern in which children proceed from almost no use of language to the point of becoming competent language users. Language develops through some of the stages discussed below. Newborn babies and young infants make a variety of sounds, which gradually get modified to resemble words. The first sound produced by babies is crying. Initial crying is undifferentiated and similar across various situations. Gradually, the pattern of crying varies in its pitch and intensity to signify different states such as hunger, pain, and sleepiness, etc. These differentiated crying sounds gradually become more meaningful cooing sounds (like ‘aaa’, ‘uuu’, etc.) usually to express happiness.

---Title---
Stages of Language Development
---Data---
At around six months of age children enter the babbling stage. Babbling involves prolonged repetition of a variety of consonants and vowel sounds (for example, da—, aa—, ba—). By about nine months of age these sounds get elaborated to strings of some sound combinations, such as ‘dadadadadada’ into repetitive patterns called echolalia. While the early babblings are random or accidental in nature, the later babblings seem to be imitative of adult voices. Children show some understanding of a few words by the time they are six months old. Around the first birthday (the exact age varies from child to child) most children enter the one-word-stage. Their first word usually contains one syllable – ma or da, for instance. Gradually they move to one or more words which are combined to form whole sentences or phrases. So they are called holophrases. When they are 18 to 20 months of age, children enter a two-word stage and begin to use two words together. The two-word stage exemplifies telegraphic speech. Like telegrams (got admission, send money) it contains mostly nouns and verbs. Close to their third birthday, i.e. beyond two-and-a-half years, children’s language development gets focused on rules of the language they hear.

---Title---
Theories of Language Acquisition
---Data---
How is language acquired? You must be wondering: “How do we learn to speak?” As with many other topics in psychology, the question of whether a behaviour develops as a result of inherited characteristics (nature) or from the effects of learning (nurture) has been raised with regard to language. Most psychologists accept that both nature and nurture are important in language acquisition. Behaviourist B.F. Skinner believed we learn language the same way as animals learn to pick keys or press bars (refer to Chapter 6 on Learning). Language development, for the behaviourists follow the learning principles, such as association (the sight of bottle with the word ‘bottle’), imitation (adults use of word “bottle”), and reinforcement (smiles and hugs when the child says something right). There is also evidence that children produce sounds that are appropriate to a language of the parent or care-giver and are reinforced for having done so. The principle of shaping leads to successive approximation of the desired responses so that the child eventually speaks as well as the adult.

---Title---
Language Use and Multilingualism
---Data---
As we have discussed earlier, language use involves knowing socially appropriate ways of communication. Knowledge of vocabulary and syntax of a language does not ensure proper use of language to achieve the purpose of communication in a variety of social situations. When we use language we have various pragmatic intentions such as requesting, asking, thanking, demanding, etc. In order to effectively serve these social goals, language use must be pragmatically correct or contextually appropriate besides being grammatical and meaningful. Bilingualism refers to attaining proficiency in communicating through any two languages. Learning of more than two languages is referred to as multilingualism. The Indian social context is characterised by grass root multilingualism which makes bi/multilingualism a characteristic at the levels of individual as well as society.

---Title---
NATURE OF MOTIVATION
---Data---
The concept of motivation focuses on explaining what "moves" behaviour. In fact, the term motivation is derived from the Latin word 'movere', referring to movement of activity. Most of our everyday explanation of behaviour is given in terms of motives. Why do you come to the school or college? There may be any number of reasons for this behaviour, such as you want to learn or to make friends, you need a diploma or degree to get a good job, you want to make your parents happy, and so on. Some combination of these reasons and/or others would explain why you choose to go in for higher education. Motives also help in making predictions about behaviour. A person will work hard in school, in sports, in business, in music, and in many other situations, if s/he has a very strong need for achievement. Hence, motives are the general states that enable us to make predictions about behaviour in many different situations. In other words, motivation is one of the determinants of behaviour. Instincts, drives, needs, goals, and incentives come under the broad cluster of motivation.

---Title---
The Motivational Cycle
---Data---
Psychologists now use the concept of need to describe the motivational properties of behaviour. A need is lack or deficit of some necessity. The condition of need leads to drive. A drive is a state of tension or arousal produced by a need. It energises random activity. When one of the random activities leads to a goal, it reduces the drive, and the organism stops being active. The organism returns to a balanced state. Thus, the cycle of motivational events can be presented as a continuous process of need, drive, goal-directed behaviour, and reduction of arousal.

---Title---
Types of motives
---Data---
Basically, there are two types of motives: biological and psychosocial. Biological motives are also known as physiological motives as they are guided mostly by the physiological mechanisms of the body. Psychosocial motives, on the other hand, are primarily learned from the individual's interactions with the various environmental factors. However, both types of motives are interdependent on each other. That is, in some kind of situations the biological factors may trigger a motive whereas in some other situations, the psychosocial factors may trigger the motive. Hence, no motive is absolutely biological or psychosocial per se, rather they are aroused in the individual with varying combinations.

---Title---
Biological Motives
---Data---
The biological or physiological approach to explain motivation is the earliest attempt to understand causes of behaviour. Most of the theories, which developed later, carry traces of the influence of the biological approach. The approach adhering to the concept of adaptive act holds that organisms have needs (internal physiological imbalances) that produce drive, which stimulates behaviour leading to certain actions towards achieving certain goals, which reduce the drive. The earliest explanations of motivation relied on the concept of instinct. The term instinct denotes inborn patterns of behaviour that are biologically determined rather than learned. Some common human instincts include curiosity, flight, repulsion, reproduction, parental care, etc. Instincts are innate tendencies found in all members of a species that direct behaviour in predictable ways.

---Title---
Hunger
---Data---
When someone is hungry, the need for food dominates everything else. It motivates people to obtain and consume food. Studies have indicated that many events inside and outside the body may trigger hunger or inhibit it. The stimuli for hunger include stomach contractions, which signify that the stomach is empty, a low concentration of glucose in the blood, a low level of protein and the amount of fats stored in the body. External cues such as the aroma, taste, and appearance of food also play a role. Our food intake is regulated by a complex feeding-satiety system located in the hypothalamus, liver, and other parts of the body as well as the external cues available in the environment.

---Title---
Thirst
---Data---
Motivation to drink water is mainly triggered by the conditions of the body: loss of water from cells and reduction of blood volume. When water is lost by bodily fluids, water leaves the interior of the cells. The anterior hypothalamus contains nerve cells called 'osmoreceptors', which generate nerve impulses in case of cell dehydration. Thus, the feeling of thirst arises from physiological signals within the body, prompting an individual to consume water and restore fluid balance.

---Title---
Sex
---Data---
One of the most powerful drives in both animals and human beings is the sex drive. Motivation to engage in sexual activity is a very strong factor influencing human behaviour. However, sex is far more than a biological motive. It is different from other primary motives in several ways: (a) sexual activity is not necessary for an individual's survival; (b) homeostasis is not the goal of sexual activity; and (c) sex drive develops with age. In human beings, the sex drive is closely regulated biologically but is also influenced by psychosocial factors, making it a complex and multifaceted motive.

---Title---
Psychosocial Motives
---Data---
Social motives are mostly learned or acquired. Social groups such as family, neighbourhood, friends, and relatives contribute significantly to acquiring social motives. These are complex forms of motives mainly resulting from the individual's interaction with her/his social environment. Key psychosocial motives include the need for affiliation, the need for power, the need for achievement, and the need for curiosity and exploration.

---Title---
Need for Affiliation
---Data---
Seeking other human beings and wanting to be close to them both physically and psychologically is called affiliation. It involves motivation for social contact. Need for affiliation is aroused when individuals feel threatened or helpless and also when they are happy. People high on this need are motivated to seek the company of others and to maintain friendly relationships.

---Title---
Need for Power
---Data---
Need for power is an ability of a person to produce intended effects on the behaviour and emotions of another person. The various goals of power motivation are to influence, control, persuade, lead, and charm others and most importantly to enhance one's own reputation in the eyes of other people. This need can be expressed in various ways, including influencing others directly, gaining strength from external sources, and leading organizations.

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
---Data---
There are various views on human motivation, the most popular among these is given by Abraham H. Maslow (1968; 1970). He attempted to portray a picture of human behaviour by arranging the various needs in a hierarchy. His viewpoint about motivation is very popular because of its theoretical and applied value which is popularly known as the "Theory of Self-actualisation." Maslow’s model can be conceptualised as a pyramid in which the bottom of this hierarchy represents basic physiological or biological needs which are basic to survival such as hunger, thirst, etc. Only when these needs are met, the need to be free from threatened danger arises. This refers to the safety needs of physical and psychological nature. Next comes the need to seek out other people, to love and to be loved. After these needs are fulfilled, the individual strives for esteem, i.e., the need to develop a sense of self-worth. The next higher need in the hierarchy reflects an individual’s motive towards the fullest development of potential, i.e., self-actualisation. A self-actualised person is self-aware, socially responsive, creative, spontaneous, open to novelty, and challenge. S/he also has a sense of humour and capacity for deep interpersonal relationships. Lower level needs (physiological) in the hierarchy dominate as long as they are unsatisfied. Once they are adequately satisfied, the higher needs occupy the individual's attention and effort. However, it must be noted that very few people reach the highest level because most people are concerned more with the lower level needs. Actual actions sometimes contradict the hierarchy of needs. Soldiers, police officers, and fire personnel have been known to protect others by facing very endangering situations, seemingly in direct contradiction to the prominence of safety needs.

Nature of emotions
---Data---
Emotions are a complex pattern of arousal, subjective feeling, and cognitive interpretation. Emotions, as we experience them, move us internally, and this process involves physiological as well as psychological reactions. Emotion is a subjective feeling and the experience of emotions varies from person to person. In psychology, attempts have been made to identify basic emotions. It has been noted that at least six emotions are experienced and recognised everywhere. These are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Izard has proposed a set of ten basic emotions, i.e., joy, surprise, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, shame, guilt, interest, and excitement with combinations of them resulting in other emotional blends. According to Plutchik, there are eight basic or primary emotions. All other emotions result from various mixtures of these basic emotions. He arranged these emotions in four pairs of opposites, i.e., joy-sadness, acceptance-disgust, fear-anger, and surprise-anticipation. Emotions vary in their intensity (high, low) and quality (happiness, sadness, fear). Subjective factors and situational contexts influence the experience of emotions. These factors are gender, personality, and psychopathology of certain kinds. Evidence indicates that women experience all the emotions except anger more intensely than men. Men are prone to experience high intensity and frequency of anger. This gender difference has been attributed to the social roles attached to men (competitiveness) and women (affiliation and caring).

Expression of emotions
---Data---
Emotion is an internal experience not directly observable by others. Emotions are inferred from verbal and non-verbal expressions which act as the channels of communication and enable an individual to express one’s emotions and to understand the feelings of others. The verbal channel of communication is composed of spoken words as well as other vocal features of speech like pitch and loudness of the voice. These non-verbal aspects of the voice and temporal characteristics of speech are called 'paralanguage'. Other non-verbal channels include facial expression, kinetic (gesture, posture, movement of the body) and proximal (physical distance during face-to-face interaction) behaviours. Facial expression is the most common channel of emotional communication. Facial expressions can convey the intensity as well as the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the individual’s emotional state. There has been some research evidence supporting Darwin's view that facial expressions for basic emotions (joy, fear, anger, disgust, sadness, and surprise) are inborn and universal. Bodily movements further facilitate the communication of emotions. Theatre and drama provide an excellent opportunity to understand the impact of body movements in communicating emotions. The roles of gestures and proximal behaviours are also significant. In Indian classical dances like Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathak, and others, emotions are expressed with the help of movements of eyes, legs, and fingers.

Culture and emotional expression
---Data---
The processes involved in emotions have been known to be influenced by culture. Cultural differences have also been found in the gaze behaviour. It has been observed that the Latin Americans and the Southern Europeans direct their gaze to the eyes of the interactant. Asians, in particular, Indians and Pakistanis, prefer a peripheral gaze (looking away from the conversational partner) during an interaction. Basic emotions also vary in the extent of elaboration and categorical labels. The Tahitian language includes 46 labels for the English word anger. North American subjects produced 40 different responses for the facial expression of anger and 81 different responses for the facial expression of contempt. The Japanese produced varied emotional labels for facial expressions of happiness (10 labels), anger (8 labels), and disgust (6 labels). Ancient Chinese literature cites seven emotions, namely, joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, dislike, and liking. Ancient Indian literature identifies eight such emotions, namely, love, mirth, energy, wonder, anger, grief, disgust, and fear. Western literature uniformly treats happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust as basic to human beings. Emotions like surprise, contempt, shame, and guilt are not accepted as basic to all. In brief, it might be said that there are certain basic emotions that are expressed and understood by all despite their cultural and ethnic differences, and there are certain others that are specific to a particular culture.
