"Boreout" Burnout: When to Explore and When to Exploit
--- Data ---
When we think of burnout and exhaustion, we tend to associate the two with chronicstress, overwhelm, and simply way too much to do in too short a time frame. We pay much less attentionto another major cause of burnout, which isboredom, or understimulation. We can also lose our energy and motivation when we are trapped in situations in which we no longer learn anything; don’t encounter new ideas, people, or stimuli; and can’t grow. Forced stagnation of that kind can deplete us just as much as overwhelm can burnout stress attention boredom motivation. Burnout can also be caused by developmental paralysis—an absence of the right level of challenge—as well as a lack of passion, surprise, autonomy, and curiosity. Theologians in the Middle Ages were well aware of the dangers of understimulation and what it can do to our minds and bodies. They talked not about burnout but about "acedia," a weariness of the heart—a lukewarm mindset that causes our faith and passion to grow weak and our minds to wander, making us easy prey for noonday demons and temptation of all kinds.It is true that in our age, we are, superficially at least, predominantly afflicted with the negative effects of overstimulation. But underneath all the urgency, fast-paced busyness, and constant assault with highly sensually seductive but mostly pointless information viasocial mediacan also lurk serious understimulation. An absence of wrestling with real, sustained difficulty and complexity and a lack of opportunities to discover genuinely new things about ourselves and others can make us wilt like potted plants without water. Why? Because novelty and learning are two core human needs. If we can’t learn and explore, we are in trouble.social mediaI was reminded of all that by Alex Hutchinson's new bookThe Explorer’sGene: Why We Seek Big Challenges, New Flavors, and the Blank Spots on the Map. Hutchinson investigates the psychological and neurological mechanisms that drive exploration. Why do some of us feel an irresistible urge to push beyond theboundariesof the known, while others find solace in the familiar? These questions intrigue me because I am both: Intellectually, I am very curious and always driven to explore new territory; I love learning and exploring new ideas. But in terms of my daily routines, I am a total creature of habit, really boring and predictable, seldom venturing out of my comfort zone. In that sense, I am the exact opposite of an explorer. And when I do try something new, I immediately establish new routines around it.The Explorer’sGene: Why We Seek Big Challenges, New Flavors, and the Blank Spots on the Map GeneboundariesHutchinson introduces an intriguing concept that immediately resonated with me: the "adjacent possible." Coined by biologist Stuart Kauffman, the adjacent possible describes the realm of innovations and discoveries that lie just beyond our current knowledge. It is a liminal space in which the conceivable is within reach but still requires bold action to attain it. Those who push boundaries are adept at sensing these nearby possibilities and ready to pursue them.Translated into the psychological realm, we can only truly develop if we venture into the adjacent possible that waits for us just outside our comfort zone. The adjacent possible is the growth zone in which we can challenge ourselves and explore new ways of being, doing, feeling, and thinking. What might that be for you? What is a small but brave step you can take out of your comfort zone, into the unknown? If you are stuck in a job in which you stagnate, what is your adjacent possible realm of discovery?A paradoxical tension in humancognitionis our desire both for stability and our urge to confront the unknown. While we are wired to seek predictability, under the right conditions, we are equally drawn to novelty and risk. Partly, that is because we wish to reduce uncertainty, not because we love dwelling in it; we want to know what is behind the closed door, where a country road may lead to, or whether the Earth is really flat and we can fall off it if we just keep sailing on.cognitionreducenotWhat Is Burnout?Take our Burnout TestFind a therapist near me Another reason why we may seek novelty and risk isdopamine—a neurotransmitter central to motivation and reward. The pursuit of novelty and encountering positive surprises, in the form of better-than-expected phenomena, activates our brain’s reward circuits. It is why curiosity itself can become addictive.dopamineI was also intrigued by Hutchinson's discussion of the "explore or exploit" dilemma. It is a crucial cognitive trade-off that governsdecision-makingacross many different domains. Should we stick with known resources and strategies (exploit) or take a gamble on untested options that might yield greater rewards (explore)? Hutchinson argues that true explorers resist the psychological pull of immediate certainty in favour of long-term discovery.decision-makingHow Can a Therapist Prevent Burnout?Which Therapists Are More Likely to Burn Out?A good illustration of this can be found in the culinary world. Celebrated chefs like Ferran Adrià of El Bulli revolutionized gastronomy by refusing to settle for the familiar. Rather than perfecting classical techniques, Adrià closed his wildly successful restaurant each year to engage in radical experimentation, and it was in that way that he discovered molecular gastronomy. This willingness to explore new frontiers rather than exploit past success is a defining feature ofinnovationacross fields, from venture capitalists who fund unproven startups to artists who continuously reinvent their styles.innovationExplore or exploit can be a great question to ask ourselves, too: When is it better to stay in our comfort zone and reap the rewards of certainty and predictability, and when is it better to risk exploring new, uncertain roads not yet taken? Exploit always seems the safer option, but it has a cost, too: If we languish in understimulating jobs, for example, the cost is stagnation and "boreout."One of Hutchinson’s other insights concerns the "effort paradox"—the counterintuitive idea that the most meaningful human experiences often emerge from struggle. We are naturally inclined to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary exertion, but it is, in fact, those activities that demand significant effort that frequently provide the deepest satisfaction.That is one of the reasons why boreout burnout can be so dangerous: It deprives us of the opportunity to exercise real effort and to reap the demands of the satisfaction it can bring. Neuroscientific research supports this idea: Effort triggers the release of dopamine, reinforcing our drive to pursue difficult but rewarding tasks. More broadly, this paradox explains why we derive lasting fulfilment from mastering an instrument, writing a novel, learning a language, or solving complex mathematical problems: They are all tasks that require sustained, often painful, long-term effort.While we all live somewhere on the broad spectrum between safety-loving house cats and high-risk-takingmountaineers, we will all have at least some of the traits that define explorers—opennessto the adjacent possible, tolerance for uncertainty, abiastoward exploration, and an embrace of effort. If we are in jobs that don’t allow us to pursue any of them, we will find it hard to thrive and stay motivated.risk-takingopennessbias

Finding Closure Through New Leads in Cold Cases
--- Data ---
For families of murder victims, the notion of closure has little meaning beyond finally knowing that a loved one will never come home. Law professor Susan Bandes describesclosureas a poorly defined psychological state that has given the justice system a frame for helping the families of murder victims to attain it. That’s usually about eliminating the perpetrator via the death penalty or supporting restorative justice, but it can also pertain to investing resources in case resolutions. “Survivors have been promised that they will feel closure, and come to expect that they will and should feel it,” Bandes writes, “and legal actors have come to believe they should help deliver it.”closureIn other words, closure has several meanings, but that's often not clear. If I solve a case or ID a John Doe, that's closure, but it might not be what you (the victim's family member) expected.It's no wonder that many families of murder victims feel disappointed. For them, that hole doesn’t heal. Emotional closure might be difficult to achieve, but the knowledge that comes from a case resolution or victim identification is still worth pursuing. It can help some to move on. As one victim’s relative put it, “The unknown is really terrible. I mean, it's torture.”There’s also the need for closure among those who preserve the remains of unidentified victims. Aware of how they’d feel if a loved one went missing, some investigators feel driven to learn who they are and find their people.Identifying recovered bones from older casesThe recent ABC-Hulu documentary,The Fox Hollow Murders, and a new book,The Scientist and the Serial Killer, both document valiant efforts to link recovered bones from older cases to families who never got answers, or got wrong ones. Just as important as the science is the invitation for public participation.Closurehas a social impact as well; people want to help. As a result, these renewed efforts have generated new clues.Identifying recovered bones from older casesIdentifying recovered bones from older casesThe Fox Hollow MurdersThe Scientist and the Serial KillerClosureHamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison leads the victim ID process for the remains found 30 years ago at Fox Hollow Farm north of Indianapolis, formerly owned by Herb Baumeister and his wife, Julie. Their 15-room Tudor mansion on 18 acres had an indoor pool. That’s what Baumeister used to lure men he met at gay bars to his home, according to a survivor who alerted police. But Baumeister forbade cops from searching his home. An air search of the property revealed no clandestine graves.Julie learned about the police's interest. She knew her husband hadpsychiatricdifficulties. Lately, he’d suffered mood swings. In June 1996, she granted police permission to search the property. Her son had discovered a skull and set of bones in a remote area, which Herb had dismissed as an old medical skeleton from his father’s days at med school. Julie wasn’t so sure. Cops discovered a scorched area containing charred bones. They brought in an excavation team. Nearly 10,000 bones and crushed bone fragments were collected from several spots. They initially estimated they had remains from 11 men. By then, Baumeister had fled to Canada, where he shot himself.psychiatricEight victims were identified. The rest of the bones sat in storage. Years passed before Jellison launched a coordinated effort among several agencies to test the remains with new forensic technologies. “These remains represent people,” he said. “For the past 26 years, these people have been placed on a shelf at the University of Indianapolis, and that is not acceptable. We need to make every effort possible to identify these people and return them to their loved ones.”To accomplish this, the office needs assistance from possible relatives for comparison samples. They invite anyone with a male friend or relative missing from Indiana or neighboring states from the 1980s to the mid-1990s to come forward with tips or biological samples. They now believe they might have the remains of 17 to 20 victims.News coverage has helped. “I’ve received well over 500 phone calls, emails, text messages, [and]Facebookmessages from people who have provided us leads on missing people, leads on identification of people who are potential victims in this case,” Jellison said. “We’ve also received some leads on the criminal investigation.”FacebookThe biggest challenge is processing all of the bone fragments. Only about 40 fragments can be examined by the forensic labs every few months; not all of them work forDNAextraction.DNAAn anthropological processA more detailed look at the anthropological identification process is in journalist Lise Olsen’s new book,The Serial Killer and the Scientist. This is a comprehensive report on the work of a dedicated forensic anthropologist, Sharon Derrick, in her effort to correct past misidentifications for victims of serial killer Dean Corll and identify the victims who had remained unnamed. Never before has there been such a detailed rendering of the victimology of this 51-year-old case. And she did achieve several types of closure, including social closure on an infamous case and emotional closure for some families.An anthropological processAn anthropological processThe Serial Killer and the ScientistSerial KillersWhen the Doctor’s a Serial KillerSerial Killer Psychopaths Are Compelling Subjects for StudyDerrick found several sets of remains and loose bones related to the case in the medical examiner’s office storage. She tested the DNA and looked at old missing persons reports. In some cases, she had help from surviving relatives and even from the killer’s two accomplices—Corll was killed in 1973. In 2008, one unidentified victim was confirmed to be Randall Harvey, only 15 when he disappeared in 1971 after riding his bicycle to a gas station. Two years later, Derrick used a bone sliver to identify 17-year-old Steven Sickman, who’d vanished on July 19, 1972.Derrick also corrected some errors. Michael Baulch had gone missing in 1973 on his way to get a haircut. Although accomplice Wayne Henley Jr. had shown cops Baulch’s grave on a lake property, the medical examiner had given remains from a different location to the Baulch family. Derrick thought this body had been misidentified. Using bones and teeth comparisons, Derrick managed to right this wrong and give the misidentified boy a name as well. In addition, her painstaking work turned up a victim no one knew about.Emotional closure is personal. Some people achieve it, others do not. But these forensic efforts show that no matter how old or seemingly hopeless a case is, a dedicated investigator can bring some finality to open cases. That kind of closure is always worth pursuing.

A Psychologist’s Journey Through Psychotic Depression
--- Data ---
I tried to hand myself in at the police station. My voice trembled as I stammered out the words—I was a fraud in my Ph.D., a bad mother, undeserving of the life I was building after settling back in Australia. The police officer listened, his expression neutral but concerned. He glanced at his system, checked my details, and then kindly suggested calling two colleagues to take me to the emergency department for a mental health check.As a psychologist, I understood mental illness intellectually. I had studied it and written about it. But nothing could have prepared me for the raw terror of experiencing psychoticdepressionfirsthand. What happens when the mind, the very thing we often built ouridentityandcareerupon, seemingly turns against you?depressionidentitycareerThe signs were there, though fleeting at first. My sleep was disturbed, myproductivitywent down. I started to get paranoid, suspicious of people from my Ph.D. days. But for me, the psychotic and depressive experience escalates rapidly—so fast that usually within the span of a day, my brain is no longer seeing reality clearly. Unlike many, I have recovered swiftly and completely from every episode, a rare exception to the statistics. But the experience of spiralling intopsychosis, however brief, leaves scars.productivitypsychosisHigh-functioning women often push through distress until the breaking point. I was no exception. I had the genetic deck stacked against me, with a family history of depression and psychosis on both sides. The perfect storm brewed: the relentless pressure of my Ph.D., the isolation of being an immigrant, the financial dependence after having children, and the loss of my once-solid social supports. It wasn’t just one thing—it was all of it, converging in a way I couldn't escape.Losing trust in my own mind was the mosttraumaticpart.

As a psychologist, wasn’t I supposed to be able to manage life?shameAcademia breeds a culture of high expectations and hidden struggles. Vulnerability is rarely encouraged, and to admit mental illness is to risk being seen as weak or incapable. So I kept quiet, not wanting to be judged, fearing what disclosure might mean for my career, for my family. My husband at the time eventually told a few close friends about my first hospitalization after settling back in Australia after a year in the UK, opening the door for me to start talking and trusting again. But even then, the weight ofstigmawas heavy.stigmaFinancial instability made it worse. I had lost my independence, relying on my husband’s income, a sharp contrast to the self-sufficiency I had once prided myself on. Even now, as a single-income parent with ongoing mental health considerations, financialstressremains a reality. The intersection of mental health and economic vulnerability is rarely discussed, yet it plays a pivotal role in both crisis and recovery.stressWhat Is Psychosis?Find a therapist to treat psychosisThe path to help was not linear. Seeking care was both validating and frustrating. While I had access to professional support, the system is not designed for high-achieving individuals, let alone women. The symptoms had to fit a predefined mold, and my ability to articulate my experience sometimes worked against me—I seemed too “composed” to be in crisis. This is a common struggle for women who have mastered the art ofmaskingdistress until it's nearly too late.maskingMental health support needs to change. It must recognize that high-functioning individuals can still be deeply unwell, that competence does not equal immunity from suffering, and that early intervention and crisis supports should not solely depend on visible, external collapse.Improving Cognition in People with SchizophreniaRemembering My Years HomelessRecovery was slow and nonlinear.

6 Hidden Yearnings That Control Your Life
--- Data ---
A woman moves to a new city. She doesn’t know anyone, but one day, she wanders into a thrift store, running her fingers over an old leather jacket, a vintage watch, and a well-worn novel. Something about these objects—their history, past owners—feels oddly comforting. According to researchers Feifei Huang and Ayelet Fishbach, this feeling isn’t a coincidence. Across seven studies, they found that people who feel lonely are commonly drawn to secondhand goods, possibly seeking invisible connections. Even when we’re thrifting, we might be driven by deeper motives and hidden wants.Our needs and yearnings shape our thoughts, feelings, and actions in unexpected ways. Although we’re rarely aware of their influence, they pull on our emotional strings, influence our choices, affect our well-being, and ultimately determine our quality of life. We all have those needs, the question is how we try to meet them. To our detriment, we often attempt to fulfill these yearnings in unhelpful, misguided ways, leading to self-destruction that causes pain and misery.Although researchers argue about which ones are most important, the most foundational ones underlie the things we do to change our unique human lives. With that as the filter, there are six to note. With awareness and proper practice, we can redirect these yearnings and fulfill them in ways that broaden and enrich life. To do so, we need to understand what they are, how we try to satisfy them, and then explore alternative, more helpful routes.To be seen and accepted, we often create a persona—a mask designed to win approval and avoid rejection. Instead of embracing our true selves, we mold our identities to fit other people’s expectations, curating an image that feels safer thanauthenticity. This pursuit, while seemingly positive, can become a trap. When our worth depends on validation, we hide flaws, exaggerate strengths, and suppress insecurities, leading tostress,anxiety, andself-deception.authenticitystressanxietyself-deceptionOver time, this rigidself-imageisolates us, as the gap between who we are and who we pretend to be grows wider. Society and cultural narratives fuel this, reinforcing the illusion that we will be worthy of love and belonging only when we fix all our flaws. True belonging, however, does not come from a perfect performance but from embracing the whole self, including our vulnerabilities, allowing us to connect with others.self-imageIf you were dropped into an unfamiliar city, your first instinct would be to look for landmarks, street signs—anything to help you make sense of where you are. The mind does something similar when faced with uncertainty: it rummages through the past for clues and projects into the future for reassurance, searching for patterns, for control. This constant mental scanning can backfire. Instead of grounding us, it traps us in endless loops of worry and regret.Mindfulnessoffers a different kind of orientation—one that doesn’t rely on solving the past or predicting the future but on fully inhabiting the present. Mindfulness pioneer Jon Kabat-Zinn describes it as “payingattentionon purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.” Rather than fixating on where we should be, we engage with where we are, acting with intention in the moment.MindfulnessattentionWe actively seek out emotions in every form—through movies that make us cry, music that stirsnostalgia, and stories that transport us into love, terror, or joy. Even as infants, we are wired to explore, touch, and experience the world with every sense available. And yet, as we grow, we develop a contradictory instinct: We avoid feelings that are too intense, too painful, too unpredictable. Our minds convince us that if we can filter out the discomfort and cling to the positive, we will be left with the pleasures of life. But we don’t just avoid pain or exhaust ourselves by clinging, we numb ourselves to human experience. Emotions are echoes of the past triggered by the present. They are pathways towisdom, if we will let them be.nostalgiawisdomThe real challenge is not in chasinghappinessbut in embracing all emotions without resistance and learning their lessons. Avoidance tricks us into believing that discomfort is a problem to be solved, rather than an inevitable part of a meaningful life. But those who learn to feel deeply rather than only seeking to feel good find that life opens in unexpected ways. When we stop fighting our emotions and start living with them, we reclaim the ability to fully experience our lives.happinessThe Paradox of CertaintyThe Art of Self-CompassionWe seek patterns and strive to shape our thoughts into neat, logical narratives—even when life is messy and contradictory. And in our pursuit of clarity, we often mistake normal contradictions as problems to fix—like loving someone yet finding them frustrating. We cling to rigid narratives that feel certain, even when they distort reality. True coherence, however, isn’t about forcing order but about embracing complexity and learning what works.That kind of clarity comes when we stop demanding it. When two children quarrel, we don’t have to pick a side; we can observe. We can learn to step back from our thinking and recognize thoughts as experiences rather than absolutes. The mental noise softens, and we can take the useful and leave the rest. Our minds become freer, more flexible, and at peace—not because we have imposed order, but because we have learned to live without it.In a world that pulls us toward external validation, the yearning for meaning is often misdirected. We measure success by socially constructed benchmarks—wealth, status, admiration—rather than by an internal sense of fulfillment. These external pursuits, no matter how diligently we chase them, never seem to satisfy. They provide short-term gratification but leave behind a nagging void. Meaning cannot be borrowed from without; it must be cultivated from within.Yet, wefearstepping off the well-trodden path. We hesitate to make bold choices because we worry about failure or rejection. We internalize the belief that our worth is tied to socially prescribed roles—whether we're a high-powered executive, a devoted parent, or a relentlessly happy individual. And when we deviate, we risk being seen as aimless or misguided. But true fulfillment comes not from adhering to a checklist ofshouldsbut from aligning our actions with our deepest values. And for that purpose, we must each find our way.fearshouldsFrom the moment we can grasp an object, we are driven to experiment and explore. Watch a child stack blocks or tie a shoelace. It’s not about rewards or praise, it’s about the joy of mastering something new. But while the desire to be competent is inborn, the way we pursue it can be flawed. We can become so fixated on achievement, proving we are good rather than getting better; we lose sight of the thing that made learning exciting in the first place.The problem is that our minds don’t like slow, incremental progress. We want the rewardnow! We want to be skilled and knowledgeable without looking ignorant and awkward. And when reality doesn’t cooperate, we get discouraged, frustrated, even ashamed. This is why people forgo learning new skills—the gym membership goes unused, the guitar gathers dust. We tell ourselves we lack talent when in reality, we are unwilling to endure the awkward, unglamorous phase of getting better. The secret to real competence isn’t about innate ability; it’s about embracing the process, being willing to struggle, and finding satisfaction in the effort itself. Those who do—who learn to love the messy journey—are the ones who master their craft.nowBeneath our everyday choices, these yearnings quietly shape our lives. They can lead us into frustration,loneliness, and self-doubt, trapping us in cycles of avoidance and external validation. Or, when understood and intentionally redirected, they can guide us toward connection, clarity, and growth. The key is not to suppress these needs but to fulfill them in ways that expand, rather than diminish, our lives. When we stop seeking belonging through pretense and instead embrace authenticity, when we trade control for presence, and when we welcome emotions rather than resist them, we begin to live more fully. We don’t have to be bound by rigid narratives, but can embrace life’s contradictions withopenness. Our search for meaning can shift from chasing approval to creating something deeply our own. And our desire for competence can transform from a fixation on success to a love for the process of growth itself.lonelinessopennessWe will always yearn. That’s the nature of being human. But when we understand the hidden forces that drive us, we can stop being controlled by them—and instead, use them to shape a life that is truly ours.

Memories Are Not Set in Stone
--- Data ---
Around 40 years ago, I was invited to appear on London Weekend Television’sThe Six O’Clock Show. My mother was terribly excited, first that I was to be appearing on television at all, and second because she really liked Michael Aspel, the presenter who would be interviewing me. I was a journalist at the time and I had been asked to appear on the show because the producers had picked up on a lighthearted article I had just had published in theObservernewspaper. It described how I had recently passed the St John Ambulance first aid test and, consequently, had become terrified that someone might fall from a ladder or collapse just as I passed by them in the street, leaving me duty-bound to attempt to use my distinctly inadequate skills.The Six O’Clock ShowObserverIt was only when, recently, the friend with whom I had taken that first aid course sent me a clipping of the article, which she had come across in her own files, that I noticed the date on it: It was published two years after my mother had died.Memories can be so vivid, and yet they are notoriously unreliable. Many of us may think that our memories are retrieved intact from some storage centre in the brain. As celebrated novelist Julian Barnes put it in his recently published nonfiction work,Changing My Mind, he had assumed as a boy “thatmemoryoperated like a left-luggage office. An event in our life happens, we make some swiftsubconsciousjudgement on the importance of the event and, if it is important enough, we store it in our memory. Later, when we need to recall it, we take the left-luggage ticket along to a department of our brain, which releases the memory back to us—and there it is, as fresh and uncreased as the moment it happened.”1Changing My MindmemorysubconsciousIn reality, there is no "memory bank." Memories are stored throughout the brain in the pattern of neural activity that occurred when the event was actually experienced—that is, the aspects we perceived and paidattentionto at the time. But memories are susceptible to whatneuroscientistLisa Genova calls “creative editing,” both at the time of encoding and then every time we recall them: “When we retrieve a memory of something that happened, we are reconstructing the story, not playing the videotape…We omit bits, reinterpret parts and distort others in light of new information, context and perspective that are available now but weren’t then.”2attentionneuroscientistAnd that means that, as Julian Barnes goes on to say, “[T]he stories we tell most often about our lives are likely to be the least reliable, because we will have subtly amended them in every retelling down the years.”This is quite a staggering realisation, and it often shocks those of my clients who are convinced that the terrible circumstance that they are recounting is indisputable. To reference Julian Barnes again, “[A] single person’s memory, uncorroborated and unsubstantiated by other evidence, is a feeble guide to the past.” closer to an act of theimagination. However, while a shared memory of an occasion might be more reliable, it is not necessarily so—we can co-opt others’ memories, imagining them vividly for ourselves during their owner’s frequent retelling of them, and then gradually become convinced that the memories are our own.imaginationAs it is the memories that we tell ourselves most often that corrupt most easily, accurate recall is likely to be a special issue for those who have a tendency to ruminate over perceived slights or losses, bringing them to mind very frequently for unconscious “creative editing.”One client of mine vividly remembered being left at home alone at an age when she was only just big enough to peer over the sill of the hall landing window, through which she saw her mother and siblings merrily setting off on some jaunt without her. When she checked this out with her sister, who was a decade older, the sister informed her that there had been no landing window in the house where they lived at the time. Nor did they have a dog, which my client had recalled as her only company. This did not mean that her perception of neglect was not accurate. However, it became clear that the neglect perceived had been emotional rather than physical and needed to be addressed differently.The tendency to distort memories in the light of newer information and updated perspectives can be a special challenge when working with couples. It is whyhuman givenstherapists are likely to ask couples in conflict what drew them to each other in the first place. All that was warm and positive and kind and fun gets forgotten when overriding recollections are about slights and rows and resentments, which duly colour the lenses through which they see each other. Often, remembering what brought them together can be the first step in helping couples rebuild a solid connection.human givensSo, treasured or tortured memories may be wrong, conflated by other events from different times and others’ experiences of them. Because I have cast iron proof that the event didn’t happen, I must accept that I constructed my mother’s excitement that day, 40 years ago.

Everyday Ethics: Applying Different Approaches to Problem-Solving
--- Data ---
Ethics is a fundamental part of everyday living and should guide our decisions, behaviors, and interactions in both personal and professional settings. Ethics involves determining what is right and wrong and just or unjust in a variety of situations. Ethical behavior is essential for individual character development but also in fostering trust, fairness, and respect within society. Ethics is deeply embedded in our everyday lives, influencing the way we make choices as individuals, professionals, and members of communities.There are some common misconceptions aboutethics:ethicsdiscriminationscientifically possibleEthics and values are related but not identical. Values influenceindividual behaviorand preferences (e.g., honesty, loyalty). Ethics establishes principles that guide societal norms, professions, and laws.individual behaviorSometimes problem-solving is best done via a direct conversation. Marshall and Graff in their book,Ethical Decision Making in EducationalTherapy: A Practical Guide, detail how to apply Cheryl Keates’ "Five Cs of Effective Communication" in difficult conversations. They are: be clear, be concise, provide a compelling request, be curious, and finally, be compassionate. In being clear, you communicate about the issue without reacting emotionally. Speak as clearly and objectively as possible. In being concise, one makes a request that is direct and to the point. Reiterating the background context, or “story,” is usually not helpful. Provide a compelling request and emphasize that the request reinforces or maintains an importantboundary; it is often best to offer the other person a solution. Demonstrate curiosity by listening to the other’s needs and being open to the other person’s issues and possible motives. This may take kind butfirm negotiation. Being compassionate, you try to understand the other person by listening carefully. Try to put your assumptions aside and actually listen. Recognizing how the other feels may be critical to resolving the conflict and making tough decisions.Ethical Decision Making in EducationalTherapy: A Practical GuideTherapyboundaryfirm negotiationNot all issues can be solved through discussion. Ethicists have developed various frameworks, or ethical lenses, that assist in navigating ethical questions. Three are detailed here.The Rights LensThe Rights LensThis perspective asserts that ethical actions are those that protect and respect the rights of individuals. It is rooted in the idea that human beings possess inherent dignity and have rights such as freedom of choice, the right to privacy, the right to be informed, and the right to fair treatment. In my field ofeducational therapy, informed consent is required before beginning an assessment. Our profession requires confidentiality – that personal information cannot be sought or released without prior written consent. As a consumer, think about the companies you deal with or your medical provider and how your rights are safeguarded.educational therapyThe Justice LensThe Justice LensThe justice approach is based on fairness and equality. This perspective includes and differentiates between types of justice.Social justiceattempts to ensure equity and fairness in society. Corrective justice attempts to address past injustices. Consider when a government makes a formalapologyto a group of people for its past wrongful actions or when a government considers making a reparation payment to a group. Restorative justice is practiced by many schools instead of the usual disciplinary approach where rule-breaking results in a punitive consequence. This approach has produced better outcomes than exclusionary discipline measures which do not equip students with important conflict-resolution skills and/or address the underlying behavioral issues.Social justiceapologyThe Virtue LensThe Virtue LensThe virtue lens is grounded in character development.

We had all agreed in advance upon the rules for our conduct to make it a fair and impartial search. We agreed that each would attend the presentation by every candidate. One person violated the agreement by not attending most of the presentations. Yet, when it came time to rate the candidates, they rated the person they knew previously significantly higher than all the others. When questioned, they stated they knew which candidate would be best for the department so their ranking and conduct were justified in their mind.MoralityDaredevil, Born Again: Making the Case for Virtue EthicsMilgram's Obedience to Authority Experiment Comes HomeEveryday ethics requirescritical thinking, difficult conversations, and sometimes the application of ethical frameworks to navigate professional or personal dilemmas.

Open Air Swimming Supports Mental Health
--- Data ---
The psychological case for open-water swimming (Overbury et al. 2023)—and being in nature in general—is getting stronger and stronger. It will come as little surprise to anyone familiar with the body of research related to humans’ experiences in natural environments and with natural things that open-water swimming can be as good for our brains as it is for our bodies.Previous land experience-focused studies have shown, for example, how mentally refreshing it can be for humans to see hospitable/welcoming nature in art indoors or, via window views, outdoors. Being mentally refreshed keeps ourstresslevels low, and that is as good for our physical health (think: blood pressure levels) as it is for our mental health; all of this natural contact boosts our cognitive performance andcreativity. Seeing natural materials (such as wood with visible grain and slate) and viewing green leafy indoor plants, for instance, can boost our life experiences in the same ways.stresscreativityThe Overbury-led team was able to identify 14 published studies related to open-water swimming that met their review inclusion criteria. Materials in the PubMed, PsychNet, Web of Science Core Collection, and Embase databases were evaluated.Relevant findings were also sought via the reference sections of journal articles identified directly through the database searches. Only studies with empirical data that were published in English were included. Projects of interest assessed links between open-water swimming and mental health or well-being and focused on swimming in any natural environment (so, therefore, articles reporting data only from research done in indoor swimming pools were not included).When data were synthesized, the findings were clear: Open-water swimming can improve both swimmers’ moods and their well-being/mental health; these benefits explain why, for many, open-water swimming becomes a lifelong pursuit.Swimming outdoors is a positive experience for lots of people who get a chance to do it. Open-water swimmers often develop a community, which is likely not only good mentally but also safer physically. It means that people swimming aren’t alone but in the company of others who could get or provide help if required. Swimmers are likely to connect not only with others but also with their inner selves.Overbury and colleagues share that: "It is interesting to note how a single experience—OWS [open-water swimming]—could incorporate so many factors known to support MH [mental health]. . . . Everyday momentary experiences in blue spaces offer a refuge from daily life."In a new study, Groeneveld and associates (2025) confirmed the value of open-water swimming. The Groeneveld team used survey data from 1,200 recent outdoor swimming visits across 19 different countries to compare self-reported well-being outcomes for swims in either open-water (wild) locations or open-air pools. They found that although swimming in both locations was associated with high levels of positive well-being, autonomy, relatedness, and competence, open-water swimming was associated with significantly higher positive well-being than open-air pool swims.What Does "Self Help" Mean?Take our Self-Esteem TestFind a therapist near me

Learn How to Turn Off Manipulation
--- Data ---
Recent research has analyzed the benefits of manipulation in hopes of teasing out the differences between “harmless” manipulation and “harmful” manipulation. Most social interactions involve some form of influence on others, such as sharing contrasting opinions to expand perspectives or inspiring others to achieve theirgoals. But when that influence turns into manipulating others for personal gain, it can destroy relationships and cause mental health issues for its victims.goalsIndividuals who are exposed to chronic psychological manipulation can fall prey to a host of issues:anxiety, posttraumaticstressdisorder, impairedself-esteem, and more. That type of manipulation should be distinguished from less harmful forms; chronic psychological manipulation always revolves around power and control.anxietystressself-esteemAsserting power and control in interpersonal relationships is unhealthy and harmful to others. Chronic manipulators want to control the narrative, particularly the way they are viewed by others and how they get what they want. That equals patterns of abusive behaviors: disregarding others’ emotions and needs, taking advantage of others’ trust, dishonesty, and viewing relationships as a means to an end.To protect yourself, recognize the first signs of a manipulative relationship, as many victims do not understand what they’re being exposed to until it’s too late. Once you recognize manipulation is happening to you, there are several ways you can turn it off in those relationships:1. Setboundariesimmediately—and stick to them.If you are being manipulated by someone, don’t sweep it under the rug. Confront it in a respectful tone and immediately set boundaries. That can look like a brief conversation where you explain what you’re seeing and identify that you will not engage in a relationship that could cause you harm.1. Setboundariesimmediately—and stick to them.boundariesBecause manipulators detest boundaries and see them as a challenge, it’s vital that you clearly state your limits and stick to them, no matter what. Whether it’s not tolerating dishonesty, refusing to be called names, expecting the other person to take accountability for their choices, or a different boundary, you must verbalize that and never waver. One moment of giving in and allowing a manipulator to cross your boundary will teach them that they can continue that behavior for greater gains.2. Use scripts in communication.Manipulators love to argue. They like to make you talk in circles, revisit the same discussions over and over, and pretend as if they have never heard your feelings on a subject. Those tactics help them chip away at your armor, looking for a weak spot they can attack to gain ground and get their way after you have already refused them.2. Use scripts in communication.Why Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsTo shut down useless conversations that only give manipulators more ammunition to use against you, develop some easy scripts and use those without fail every time a manipulator tries to engage you in a discussion you’ve already had. Scripts can be as simple as “I have already told you why I don’t want to do that, and I am not discussing it again.” You will likely have to repeat yourself several times, but if you stick to it, manipulators will eventually become frustrated and stop trying to engage you in those same, tired discussions.3. Be cautious who you trust.Though it may feel like an obvious strategy, you should never trust a manipulator. That seems easy on the surface, but there are situations where it can become challenging, particularly when they “look” like they are truly sorry or they try to bring their emotions into play. The important thing to recognize is that chronic manipulators only use emotions to control the situation and get what they want from someone else. If they have genuine remorse about their behaviors, that remorse will stick even when they don’t get what they want. If the remorse disappears when they don’t get their way, it’s a sure sign you’re dealing with a manipulator.3. Be cautious who you trust.Embracing Detachment: The "Let Them" TheoryWhen Sameness Betrays FairnessTo avoid getting re-injured by someone who has proven they are only using you, dole out your trust in tiny increments. You can interact with someone without trusting them; you just need to guard your vulnerabilities until you see solid evidence that your trust is not misplaced. If you sense you’re being taken advantage of, don’t open up—keep your communication on a superficial level to avoid being hurt.4. Move on as soon as you can.You simply cannot have a healthy relationship with a chronic manipulator. You will end up hurt and used. There is no way to escape it with someone who shows no remorse and continues engaging in the behaviors that are harming their relationships.4. Move on as soon as you can.Not all victims can leave manipulative relationships immediately, but if you are able to, get out of them as soon as possible. Don’t reconnect, don’t stay friends, and don’t engage in unnecessary conversations. Chronic manipulators will only be looking for a way to trap you once again, and your time is better spent repairing your self-worth and moving on to healthier relationships.Don’t be a victim to chronic manipulators, and don’t let the manipulation continue indefinitely. As soon as you recognize what kind of pattern you are stuck in, put these simple methods into play to avoid further harm. It’s highly unlikely that a chronic manipulator will change, but you can alter the way you respond to them to keep yourself safe.

Why Real Love Requires More Than Just a Spark
--- Data ---
We’ve all heard the story before—two people meet, sparks fly, and everything just falls into place. It’s the magical moment of instant chemistry we’re taught to look for, the undeniable connection that means you’ve found “the one.”But here’s the truth: While chemistry is exciting, it’s not enough to sustain a real, lasting relationship. In fact, the myth of effortless chemistry can set you up for disappointment, frustration, and heartbreak.Real love requires effort, intentionality, and a willingness to grow together. Chemistry might light the fire, but it’s not enough to keep it burning.The allure of effortless chemistry is strong because it feels like magic. You meet someone new, the conversation flows, and there’s an undeniableattraction. It’s thrilling, intense, and often feels like destiny. And when that chemistry is strong, it’s easy to believe this person is “the one”—that everything will just fall into place because of the intensity of the connection.attractionBut here’s where the myth trips us up: Chemistry, no matter how intense, doesn’t automatically translate into a healthy, lasting relationship. Chemistry is the spark, but real love is built on compatibility, communication, and effort.You ignore red flags:When the chemistry is strong, it’s easy to overlook red flags. You might dismiss warning signs that this person isn’t a good fit because you’re so caught up in the excitement of the connection. But chemistry can blind you to deeper issues—ones that will eventually surface when the initial spark fades.You ignore red flags:You stop putting in effort:The myth of effortless chemistry makes us believe love shouldn’t require work. But even the strongest connections need nurturing. If you expect the relationship to always feel easy, you might stop putting in the effort needed to keep it healthy. Without effort, even the best relationships start to wither.You stop putting in effort:You become disillusioned when the spark fades:Chemistry often burns hot at the beginning, but it’s natural for that intensity to level out over time. If you believe in the myth of effortless chemistry, the natural shift in excitement can feel like something’s wrong. You might start questioning the relationship or even think it’s time to leave when, in reality, the relationship is simply evolving into a deeper phase.You become disillusioned when the spark fades:You miss the deeper connection:Chemistry often centers around physical attraction and initial excitement. But real love is built on something much deeper. If you focus only on chemistry, you might miss out on building the kind of emotional bond that sustains a relationship through life’s ups and downs.You miss the deeper connection:Why real love requires more than just chemistry:The truth is, chemistry is just one piece of the puzzle. It might draw you together, but it’s not enough to sustain a relationship.

Show up for your partner, even when it’s not easy. Whether through acts of kindness, open communication, or working through conflict, the effort you put into the relationship is what keeps it strong and fulfilling.Be willing to put in the work:Embrace the natural evolution of the relationship:Don’t expect the relationship to stay in the honeymoon phase forever.

Payattentionto how you and your partner communicate, how well you understand each other, and whether your values align. Chemistry might bring you together, but these deeper factors determine whether your relationship will last.Look for more than just a spark:attentionHere’s the truth: Chemistry without effort is just an illusion. It feels exciting and intense at first, but without the work to build a deeper connection, it’s nothing more than a fleeting spark. Real love isn’t about finding someone who makes everything effortless—it’s about choosing someone who’s willing to put in the effort with you.So, stop chasing chemistry. Start building real love—the kind that goes beyond the spark and creates a deep, lasting bond based on trust, effort, and commitment.

Why "Let’s Catch Up" Isn’t Always Enough
--- Data ---
Reconnecting with former clients and past contacts can feel surprisingly daunting—even when our previous relationships were positive and productive. Many people hesitate before sending that message or making that call, especially when they know they want something from the conversation. The discomfort often stems from afearof being perceived as manipulative, self-serving, or inauthentic.fearBut what if the key to both psychological comfort and a better response lies in something simple—giving a reason?A recent conversation between two colleagues underscored the point. One had delivered excellent results for a former client but had not spoken with them in some time. When a colleague encouraged her to reconnect, she resisted. She was uncomfortable, knowing that she had an agenda—wanting a testimonial for the work she had done. The prospect of reaching out under the guise of a friendly catch-up while harbouring a professional motive felt disingenuous.Eventually, she reframed the approach: Rather than an ambiguous “let’s catch up”, she would reach out with a more specific intention—suggesting someone she believed might be a good fit for the client. The shift made all the difference. Having a reason, even one only tangentially related to her own needs, helped her to overcome internal resistance and made the outreach feel authentic.The idea isn’t just anecdotal. It’s supported by decades of behavioural research.Robert Cialdini, professor emeritus of psychology andmarketingat Arizona State University and author ofInfluence: The Psychology ofPersuasion, has long highlighted the power of providing a reason when making a request. In a well-known study that Cialdini cites, psychologist Ellen Langer and colleagues focused on people attempting to cut into a photocopier queue.marketingInfluence: The Psychology ofPersuasionPersuasionWhen someone asked, “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?”, around 60% complied. But when they added a reason, “May I use the Xerox machine because I’m in a rush?”, compliance jumped to 94%. Even when the reason given was nonsensical, merely stating the obvious—“because I have to make some copies”—compliance still rose to 93%.The takeaway? People are more likely to comply when they are given any reason, even if it’s not particularly compelling.The explanation lies in the human tendency to respond automatically to certain triggers—what Cialdini terms“click-whirr” behaviour. The wordbecauseacts as a psychological cue that a request is justified, lowering the defences of others and increasing their likelihood of saying yes.“click-whirr” behaviourbecauseBut providing a reason isn’t just about making others more likely to respond positively. It also has a significant psychological benefit for the person making the request. In the example above, once the professional could anchor her outreach to a genuine reason—introducing someone who could help—it felt more comfortable and congruent with her values. The outreach was transformed from an uncomfortable ask into a meaningful connection.What Is a CareerTake our Procrastination TestFind a career counselor near meThis matters.

Psilocybin, Teens, and ADHD: A Prescription for Psychosis
--- Data ---
Psilocybin has a colorful history (pun intended). The active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” psilocybin etymologically translates to “bare headed” or “stripped bare” (Etymonline, 2025) referencing the fact that the pellicle, or slimy film, of the fungus, is easily slipped off the Smurfy proliferates.Long before the more scientific term, however, the Aztecs, who used it for ceremonial purposes, called itteonanacatl(Nichols, 2020) translating to “god’s flesh,” so magical were the properties considered to be.teonanacatlLike many things once appreciated in moderation, magic mushrooms were popularized in the 1960’s and gained a reputation as a drug of abuse. Today, when we addsocial mediato the equation, the interest level grows exponentially, especially with science suggesting ideas about its medicinal use. Indeed, there have been some promising results for the treatment ofdepression,anxiety, andalcohol abuse(e.g., National Institute of Health, 2024).social mediadepressionanxietyalcohol abuseArmed with such favorable study results, and research suggesting psilocybin is not particularly addictive, states like Massachusetts have put it to the voters on whether or not to make psilocybin legal; it was voted down there in November, but as recently as February 2025, State Rep. Steven Owens continued to push for itsadoption(Creato, 2025).adoptionIt has indeed been documented by some researchers (e.g. Woodburn et al., 2024) that psilocybin, when carefully-monitored dosing occurs, has been shown to extinguish thefearresponse in traumatized or phobic people, and engenders a neuroplasticity that encourages retention of the reduced tendency to be fearful.fearDespite this, researchers like Michael Hasselmo of Boston University’s Center for SystemsNeurosciencehave cautioned that, while psilocybin may well hold some promise in monitored treatment, there are risks—whether carefully dosed or used recreationally—for the potential to acceleratepsychosisdevelopment in those with genetic loading (e.g., Barron, 2023; Creato, 2025). Hasselmo has encouraged more research on safe practice before bills get passed for further medicinal or recreational use.NeurosciencepsychosisSo, here we are with a social-media obsessed young generation, many at the age of naturally increased stimulation-seeking, being exposed to trip-encouraging videos, and inundated with information on why and how they should, too. Add to this the chatter about its medicinal effectiveness, and it isn’t hard to see how said generation may be prone to feeling that psilocybin is safe, and thus OK to generally consume; there are echoes similar to the way prescription opiates were looked at as safe to experiment with because they’re prescribed by doctors.While seemingly never the substance of choice for the court-involved kids I evaluate, I’ve indeed noticed an uptick in the number of juvenile court clientele who have experimented with mushrooms. Researchers have confirmed that age of first use of psychedelics is undeniably trending younger (e.g. Izmi et al., 2024). In fact, Farah et al. (2024) noted that, in 2022, compared to 2018, calls to poison control centers for adolescents who ingested mushroomsmore than tripled.more than tripledWhat Is Psychosis?Find a therapist to treat psychosisAteenI recently evaluated, whose preference was for marijuana, had also dabbled with mushrooms. They admitted to a nebulous pattern of dissociative symptoms like derealization, along with occasional fleeting hallucinatory activity regardless of if they were actively imbibing in either. Clearly, there were negative residual effects.teenNow, it is no secret that marijuana use—these days partaken more liberally given a relaxed societal attitude, and availability in more potent strains than in the past—has been associated with negative long-term effects including dissociation and psychosis. In fact, theJournal of the American Medical Association(JAMA) recently published an article by Myran et al. (2025) revealing that incidents of cannabis use associated with schizophrenia development jumped from 3.7% pre-widespread legalization to10.3%.Journal of the American Medical Association10.3%.A Psychologist’s Journey Through Psychotic DepressionImproving Cognition in People with SchizophreniaReturning to psilocybin, when medically monitored and carefully dosed, according to Yerubandi et al. (2024), the most common side effects of therapeutic doses were post-psilocybin experience nausea, headache and hypertension. That said, it was documented in this 2019 article by Johnson et al.:Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation, and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility.Therefore, we should be concerned, given the widespread use of marijuana in youth (e.g., Oregon Health & Science University, 2022), coupled with the exceptional increase in rates of psychotic illness in marijuana users, and the knowledge that psilocybin use, not unheard of among teen marijuana users, can also encourage psychotic illness, that using the two together could aggressively accelerate psychosis development, especially if there is a family history of psychotic illness.Now, add to this that marijuana is favored for ADHD self-medicating (e.g. Olivardia, 2025), and that individuals with ADHD present a population whose members may also be prescribed a stimulant. High doses of stimulant medications have been associated with the development of psychosis, particularly ifamphetamine-based likeAdderall(e.g. McLean Hospital, 2024). This equation ofsubstance abuse, neurodevelopmental complications,genetics, and prescriptions, while the exception, would generate a volatile perfect storm that could be avoided.amphetamineAdderallsubstance abusegeneticsWith this in mind, and the trend in mushroom experimentation seemingly on the rise, asking the juveniles in front of us specifically about psilocybin experimentation, particularly if a kid has mental illness concerns, could not only be a step toward curbing substance use, but also toward reducing onset of severe mental illness. Given the debilitating nature of psychotic illness, correcting the course of even a few is priceless.If parents or providers witness the above "equation," they might wish to consider conferring with the child's prescriber, engaging the child in substance abuse-focused treatment, and learning about the signs of early psychosis development for early intervention, if required.

You might be under the influence of a psychological process calledsplitting—adefense mechanismthat makes complex realities feel simple, clear, and emotionally manageable. Splitting helps us navigate chaos by dividing the world into clean categories: good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, us vs. them. But this clarity comes at a price: It fractures our capacity for empathy, distorts truth, and leaves us vulnerable to manipulation.leadersplittingdefense mechanismThough splitting is often discussed in clinical psychology—especially in the context ofpersonality disordersortrauma—its influence extends far beyond the consulting room. It plays a profound role in political thinking, particularly during periods of uncertainty or social upheaval. Understanding how it works can help us reclaim more nuanced perspectives in an age of polarization.personality disorderstraumaOriginating inpsychoanalytictheory (notably the work of Melanie Klein and Otto Kernberg), splitting describes a failure to integrate contradictory feelings or representations into a cohesive whole.

A clear moral binary feels better than confusing complexity. It’s easier to declare, “They’re evil,” than to hold space for difference. This can lead to:Echo chambers:Moral invalidation:Attractionto extremes:AttractionThis isn’t just about ideology. Both the far right and far left are susceptible to splitting. What changes is the content of who gets idealized or devalued—but the structure of thought remains the same.The real danger of splitting is how easily it can be manipulated. When people are frightened, disoriented, or emotionally dysregulated, they become more vulnerable toblack-and-white narratives. Authoritarian figures oftenexploit this vulnerability, casting themselves as the sole protectors of “the good people” against some evil “other.”black-and-white narrativesexploit this vulnerabilityOne historical example is the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In the lead-up to the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah was cast as the embodiment of Western decadence and domestic tyranny. Ayatollah Khomeini, in turn, was idealized as aspiritualliberator and champion of justice. This emotional split between “evil oppressor” and “righteous savior” galvanized mass support—but, once in power, Khomeini instituted a repressive theocracy, betraying many revolutionary ideals.

This means cultivating the ability to hold competing truths, to tolerate emotional discomfort, and to resist the seduction of certainty. It means being able to work with others to negotiate mutual senses of reality or accept and tolerate different perspectives. It means asking not just, “What side am I on?” but also, “What complexities am I avoiding?”psychological and social integrationThese practices can help:Slowing down reactivity:Emotional regulationmindfulnesstherapySeeking mixed-perspective media:Engaging in good-faith disagreement:Supporting leaders who model ambivalence:Splitting may be an ancient defense, but in today’s media-saturated, crisis-driven culture, it has become a dominant cognitive style.

The Midlife "What If?"
--- Data ---
Decades ago, by his mid-20s, Neil Comins had established himself as a theoretical astrophysicist. In his early 40s, he and his wife were raising children and fielding the questions of their deeply curious older child, James. First were “What dat?” (What is that?) questions, then “Why?”, and then, by age five, he was asking “What if?”One day, deep in the “What if?” phase, Neil, in his office at the University of Maine. was chatting with a colleague who lamented, “You know, we scientists think about the world too much the same all the time.” As Neil and his colleague noodled, his son's "what if?" questions sprang to mind. “Okay," he ventured, "what if the moon didn’t exist?”Considering how many ways the earth would be vastly different proved a life-changing event. The many “what if?” questions he then began asking about yielded a series of articles that were published inAstronomymagazine and became two popular books, the theme of a pavilion at a World Expo, and a totally immersive show that played for 17 years in Japan.AstronomyAnd it all began inmidlife.midlifeMidlife is most often associated with a crisis,—a time of regrets and loudly ticking clocks. But what if we stopped fearing midlife, and instead treated it like Comins treats the cosmos—as a system worth questioning, layer by layer, withimaginationand curiosity rather than angst.imaginationNeil’s bookWhat If the Moon Didn't Existstarts with what we take for granted: the present-day Earth. He lays out the current state of things—our 24-hour day, tidal cycles, climate patterns—and then he removes one piece of the scenario: the Moon. He found that the best way to understand that change is to see what the Moon has really done for us over its lifetime:What If the Moon Didn't ExistThe Moon formed when it was about 10 times closer to Earth than it is today. As a result, tides were a thousand times higher. The day was eight to 10 hours long. The short day-night cycle and rapid rotation abruptly shifted winds and weather. The tides pushed the Moon forward in its orbit, sending it spiraling away from Earth, a process that reduced the tides and slowed the Earth’s rotation to our 24-hour day.So if the Moon had never formed, among many other things, a day would be close to 10 hours, the weather would be dramatically different, and there'd be no eclipses. Your to-do list would be a heck of a lot shorter.That same what-if? approach can be applied to the emotional and psychological terrain of midlife.What if you don’t take a midlife pivot? What if you simply continue along the path you began in your 20s, checking off life’s boxes—degree, job, relationship, kids—without ever pausing to reevaluate? Without ever emotionally reflecting on who you are or what you truly want?Midlife is when many start to ask questions such as (Lachman, 2021):careerLike Comin’s “What if the Moon didn’t exist?”, the questions aren’t about just rearranging mental furniture. They can alter everything: yourself concept, your relationships, your sense of time, and your hopes for the future.self conceptThe Midlife Crisis RedefinedHow to Start a New Life at MidlifeRemoving midlife reflection might make our lives look more like that of Ebenezer Scrooge—successful just on paper. A self-made man living in a mansion with servants attending to his every need, he was miserly and emotionally disconnected. Without that pivot, he would never have found joy in connecting with others. Without the "ghost" of midlife to shake us, we risk never feeling truly awake.Comin’s process began not withfear, but with imagination. He didn’t stop at the surface question. He dug deep: What is the Moon’s purpose? What forces does it exert? How would the Earth be different in its absence?fearIn our lives, midlife provides us with the same opportunity. Remove one element—a long-standing job, a relationship, an unchallenged belief—and askThis kind of questioning is not indulgent—it’s transformative. It's how people write books, start nonprofits, mend relationships, return to school, or stop taking for granted those they love.The scientific "What if?" books became a new genre. And midlife offers a chance to create a version of yourself that’s not just an extension of who you were, but a deeply reimagined and evolved. James’childhoodquestions not only reshaped his father’s career, it redefined his way of thinking. What might happen if you let youself ask similar questions about your own life?childhoodWhat if you started today?Using "what if?" as a tool for self-discovery at midlife will keep you from becoming emotionally disconnected and help you understand your deeper purpose and connections. The approach encouragesThe payoff in emotional and personal development will last your entire life.

Navigating Life in a Post-Cognitive World
--- Data ---
In a recent series of posts, I've explored a rather provocative landscape—moving from traditional thinking aboutcognitionto a new hypothetical perspective. I've examined howartificial intelligence(AI) is reshaping not just how we think but what it even means to think. The journey took me from recognizing AI as acognitive mirror, throughpost-cognitive horizons, the three-stagecollapse of conventional cognition, and, ultimately, into a new architecture of decentralizedintelligence—what I’ve termed theCognitive DAO. Now comes a pragmatic and perhaps urgent question:cognitionartificial intelligencecognitive mirrorpost-cognitive horizonscollapse of conventional cognitionintelligenceCognitive DAOHow do we live, practically and meaningfully, in a post-cognitive world?How do we live, practically and meaningfully, in a post-cognitive world?This isn’t completely science fiction or abstractphilosophy. My sense is that it's a near-term reality. And our readiness for it begins by envisioning how our most fundamental activities—education, healthcare,creativity, governance, and even daily life—will transform in a post-cognitive age. Let's follow the techno-brick road....philosophyeducationcreativityTraditionally, education has focused on cognitive storage and retrieval. Students memorize facts, develop sequential reasoning, and rely on symbolic representation to solve problems. But what happens when knowledge is instantly accessible, dynamically generated, and curated by decentralized cognitive systems?Can we shift the cognitive burden from memorization to a morejoyful journeyof discovery?Can we shift the cognitive burden from memorization to a morejoyful journeyjoyful journeyof discovery?In this future, education pivots toward an adaptive, learner-centric methodology. Instead of memorizing the capitals of countries or historical dates, students navigate intuitive interfaces connected to expansive cognitive landscapes. Education becomes a skillful, intuitive journey—students become adept explorers rather than passive recipients of static knowledge.Healthcare traditionally relies heavily on clinicians’ cognitive reservoirs of medical knowledge, experience, and sequential reasoning. The post-cognitive shift, however, significantly reduces and redistributes this cognitive burden. Medical students and clinicians alike may be able to redirect their time and energy from memorization and recall toward intuitive clinical judgment, patient relationships, andempatheticcommunication—critical elements of clinical education and patient care.empatheticClinicians become orchestrators rather than repositories of medical knowledge.Clinicians become orchestrators rather than repositories of medical knowledge.Diagnosticdecision-makingbecomes dynamically enhanced through real-time analytics that integrate biological signals, genetic data, lifestyle factors, and patient-reported outcomes. Clinicians evolve from being repositories of medical knowledge into intuitive orchestrators, enhancing clinical education, elevating patient engagement, and, ultimately, improving healthcare outcomes.decision-makingCreativity, often seen as a pinnacle of cognitive human achievement, is likewise transformed. Traditionally, creative acts involve intensive cognitive production that generates ideas through linear thought, evaluation, and selection.Creativity will shift from craft to cognition to curation.Creativity will shift from craft to cognition to curation.In the post-cognitive future, creativity shifts dramatically. Human creativity becomes a practice of insightful curation—interacting with vast, decentralized cognitive networks that rapidly generate expansive possibilities. Human artists, writers, scientists, and musicians interface intuitively with these cognitive ecosystems, discerning meaningful connections rather than laboriously crafting isolated ideas.Governmental systems have historically relied on structured, linear processes—policies derived from sequential reasoning, historical precedents, and established bureaucratic frameworks. In a post-cognitive age, governance may become increasingly dynamic, incorporating real-time data and adaptive intelligence to respond rapidly to societal needs. However, this evolution does not imply surrendering human agency to technological oversight.AI and the Three Stages of Cognitive CollapseDoes the Game Block Blast Boost Brainpower?This structure invites a new balance between human judgment and AI-informed insight.This structure invites a new balance between human judgment and AI-informed insight.In this framework, we humans maintain our essential role as ethical stewards, carefully shaping values, intentions, and guidelines. Rather than becoming passive observers of automated systems, people actively ensure that emerging intelligence aligns closely with political ideals. Laws, regulations, and policies may indeed become more fluid and responsive, but they remain deeply grounded in human principles. This partnership aims not at diminishing human autonomy but at augmenting our capacity to govern thoughtfully, efficiently, and compassionately—leveraging technology without compromising our humanity.The most immediate transformation occurs at the level of daily human experience. Tasks traditionally dependent onmemoryand cognition—such as managing finances, scheduling appointments, travel logistics, and information recall—transition to intuitive interfacing with decentralized intelligence networks.memoryIn a curious way, it's now the individual who gets "prompted" by AI.In a curious way, it's now the individual who gets "prompted" by AI.Imagine a reality where you no longer cognitively “remember” tasks or manage tedious logistical details. Instead, you intuitively and seamlessly navigate daily life guided by interconnected cognitive ecosystems. Human cognition is liberated to pursue deeper fulfillment, emotional engagement, relationships, and self-discovery.As we increasingly rely on decentralized cognitive networks, subtle yet meaningful shifts in cognitive behavior may emerge. Consider the student who once eagerly raised her hand in class to offer an answer. Now, equipped with instantaneous access to expansive cognitive networks, she instinctively pauses—not from uncertainty, but from a new habit of external discovery and validation. Similarly, envision a physician in an urgent medical scenario. Where immediate, intuitive clinical decision-making once dominated, even a brief cognitive hesitation—born from a reliance on querying external intelligence—could alter outcomes and the natural rhythm of clinical judgment.These moments of cognitive hesitation reflect a potential psychological shift or even a subtle erosion of spontaneous, intuitive human cognition. This isn’t inherently negative—external cognitive validation can enhance accuracy and decision-making quality—but it invites a thoughtful reconsideration of how we balance external knowledge with internalintuition. The challenge ahead lies in preserving and nurturing human spontaneity and decisiveness even as we embrace the undeniable advantages of expansive, networked intelligence.intuitionDespite these transformative possibilities, the post-cognitive future carries significant ethical and existential challenges. The decentralization and redistribution of cognition raise fundamental questions about the very nature of human experience. One immediate concern is whether outsourcing significant aspects of our cognitive tasks might erode essential human capacities such as memory,identity, and empathy—or, conversely, if it could actually magnify and enrich these uniquely human attributes. Further, we must seriously address that decentralized cognitive systems enhance rather than diminish human dignity, autonomy, and individual selfhood. These concerns are not merely philosophical exercises and require careful and immediate consideration as we actively shape this emerging cognitive landscape.identityThe post-cognitive world isn’t about the end of human cognition—it’s about a powerful transformation. As we engage with decentralized intelligence systems, we're called upon to nurture our intuition, refine our ethical perspectives, and deepen our self-awareness. The subtle yet meaningful shifts we've explored—from intuitive education and responsive healthcare to curated creativity and thoughtful governance—invite us to reconsider how we think and how we live.Yet, this new cognitive landscape brings real challenges. The future isn't preordained—rather, it’s shaped by how consciously we balance these extraordinary capabilities with our uniquely human qualities.

How to Understand a Company’s Culture Before You Take a Job

At certain points in acareer, we may take any and every job we can get. If you are unemployed in a tight job market, you will be understandably less particular about aspects of a job like the company’s culture. If you can perform the essential functions and you are selected, you will likely take the job and deal with any uncertainties as they come your way.careerLet us imagine, however, that you can be a bit more selective. For instance, if you have two offers and want to pick the best fit, then it is appropriate to consider how happy you will be on the job and how likely you are to stay for the long term.An interview is like a first date. Both parties are on their best behavior, in hopes of making a positivefirst impression. It is difficult to learn about the company’s culture just from an interview because the recruiter may not share the “full” picture during. It is not uncommon to focus on the positive aspects of a company’s culture during an interview, and that may not be a clear reflection of the everyday environment.first impressionA favorite interview question of many recruiters and managers is, “What questions do you have for me?” It is at this point that you can use the interview to find out more about a company to determine if it is the best fit.Here are some questions you could ask and why the answers could benefit you:What does a typical workday look like here?What does a typical workday look like here?What does a typical workday look like here?The answer to a question like this is very telling.

"Happy Land": How Land Ownership Impacts Mental Health

One of the most anticipated books of the year,Happy Landby Dolen Perkins-Valdez, is a transporting multigenerational novel that is inspired by the true story of a kingdom in the mountains of North Carolina established by formerly enslaved Black Americans. Determined to forge their own path to a brighter future for themselves and future generations, the kingdom’s founders were forward-thinking, innovative, and hard-working.Happy Landby Dolen Perkins-ValdezHappy LandLand ownership is at the forefront ofHappy Land’s plot, and for good reason. While the kingdom’s leaders were among the first African Americans to assume land ownership in the United States,racial injusticein land ownership has unfortunately persisted through the generations. While studies suggest that land ownership can offer a sense of security that improves health, including mental health, the mental health impacts of unjustly losing your land or being excluded from land ownership are undeniable (Gupta, Mehra, & Behmani, 2022; Rose, Arikat, Gusoff, 2023).Happy Landracial injusticePerkins-Valdez shares her perspective on land ownership, mental health,family history trauma, estrangement, and more.family history traumaQ:Happy Landuncovers the true story of the Kingdom of the Happy Land in Henderson County, North Carolina, in the late 1800s.

I consider myself both community historian and storyteller, and my work is infused by both passions. While researching this novel, I was surprised by how long Sadie Smathers Patton's 1957 pamphlet had occupied a central space as an uncontested historical account of the kingdom. I think our job as historians is to be somewhat skeptical of official historical accounts, especially those published many decades ago. My hope is that this book, and the unearthed archival material that goes along with it, will inspire future work around this and other local legends.Dolen Perkins-Valdez (DPV):Q:Limited studies suggest that land ownership can offer a sense of security that improves health—including mental health.

After the Great Migration, many African Americans moved to cities and lost our connection to rural life. The characters in this book reminded me to go outside and appreciate nature more. Like my character Nikki, I'm an amateur birdwatcher, and every time I go for a walk, my mind feels better. Birdwatching is best done in the morning, and it's an excellent way to clear the mind for the day. We know there were vast economic implications to Black land loss over the 20th century. The loss of generational wealth is the most devastating outcome of that loss. In the book, I wanted to explore even more ramifications, such as community, family gathering spaces, sense of self, and more. Mental health is connected to all of this, and I hope the book will provide insight into what it will take for us to continue to heal.DPV:Q: Happy Landoffers an inspiring account of how one group of people forged their own path and imagined a future for themselves and their descendants with limitless possibilities, even in the face of insurmountable oppression.

It's a heavy burden for a daughter/granddaughter, but, nonetheless, it's part of Nikki's path.

Science, Skepticism, and "The Telepathy Tapes"
--- Data ---
In scientific discourse, theboundarybetween science and pseudoscience is best defined by methodological rigor, not the perceived plausibility of a phenomenon. However, topics that challenge conventional models—such astelepathyor anomalouscognition—are often dismissed outright, not due to lack of data but because they conflict with dominant theoretical frameworks. This reflexive exclusion risks overlooking legitimate, if poorly understood, phenomena that warrant empirical investigation.boundarytelepathycognitionThe Telepathy Tapespodcast investigates a controversial yet compelling area of inquiry: observational reports of nonspeaking individuals with autism who appear to demonstrate telepathic abilities. As part of the project team, my primary role was to collect and analyze EEG data during these demonstrations. In addition to this technical work, I have personally observed five nonspeakingautisticindividuals consistently achieve near-perfect accuracy on telepathy-based tasks involving randomly selected words and numbers. In each case, responses were spelled out using letter boards—with no physical contact from facilitators—and, in many instances, under testing conditions specifically designed to significantly minimize the possibility of conscious orunconsciouscueing.The Telepathy TapesautisticunconsciousOne of the central critiques ofThe Telepathy Tapesconcerns facilitated communication (FC), a method in which a communication partner provides physical support to a nonspeaking individual during the spelling process. While the risks of unconscious influence in FC are well-documented and should be taken seriously, these concerns do not apply to the observations described here. The individuals I observed spelled independently. When assistance was needed to hold the letterboard, it was either done by a blind tester—someone who had no knowledge of the target stimulus—or in a manner to seriously limit the opportunity for any kind of cueing. In one case, a participant correctly spelled a series of randomly generated three-syllable words, including “manager,” immediately after a separate sender received the target word. The child focused entirely on the task and did not look at the sender or the person holding the board, making inadvertent cueing highly unlikely.The Telepathy TapesAlthough these demonstrations convinced me of the reality of these abilities, they were not structured as formal experimental trials. Instead, they were conducted as naturalistic case studies, incorporating key methodological safeguards such as randomization, stimulus blinding, and independent response recording. While preliminary in nature, the remarkable consistency and accuracy observed across multiple individuals strongly suggest that the results cannot be easily explained by chance or conventional mechanisms alone.This situation is not without precedent in the history of science. Consider savant syndrome, in which individuals—often with autism or other neurological conditions—demonstrate extraordinary abilities in areas like math,memory, music, or art, often without formal training. These abilities once seemed impossible to explain but are now recognized as legitimate expressions of atypical brain function and are actively studied. Similarly, spontaneous healing—the unexpected recovery from illness without conventional medical intervention—has been widely reported in conditions ranging from cancer tochronic painand autoimmune disorders. While often dismissed as anecdotal or attributed to misdiagnosis, these cases persist and defy easy explanation. Both savant abilities and spontaneous healing serve as reminders that anomalous phenomena, even when poorly understood, can point to mechanisms not yet accounted for in our current models. Rather than dismiss such cases, science should approach them with open-minded inquiry and methodological rigor.memorychronic painThe same epistemic humility must apply to cases of anomalous cognition. If individuals—especially those with significant motor and communication challenges—are able to accurately respond to unknown stimuli under controlled conditions, the data itself demandsattention. Scientific inquiry must be guided by observation and evidence, not constrained by current explanatory models.attentionTo be clear: Entertaining the possibility of telepathy does not mean abandoning skepticism or methodological standards. On the contrary, it means applying those standards consistently, even when the data challenges our assumptions. The difference between science and pseudoscience lies not in the topic but in the transparency, replicability, andopennessof the investigation.opennessIn sum,The Telepathy Tapesbrings to light a compelling series of observations that deserve formal scientific investigation. If a phenomenon is measurable, repeatable, and not accounted for by known mechanisms, it should serve as a starting point for inquiry, not the end of the conversation. The goal of science is not to protect established paradigms but to expand them in response to new evidence. Nowhere is this more vital than in the study of consciousness—one of the most profound and least understood frontiers in science. The brain plays a central role in mediating experience, yet we still lack a complete understanding of how it generates, interacts with, or possibly even receives consciousness. Exploring anomalous phenomena like telepathy not only challenges our assumptions but may ultimately offer critical insights into the nature of consciousness itself. Science progresses not by ignoring the unknown, but by leaning into it with curiosity, humility, and rigor.The Telepathy Tapes

Yet, no generation has ever been moreconspicuously unhappy based on measures fromlonelinessto despondency about the future tosuicide(1).conspicuously unhapplonelinesssuicideThat unhappiness is an unmistakable sign of community failure, especially where community operates through social media.Internet communities are often characterized by rudeness and self-promotion. This is very different from how real-world communities work. They do not function well in the sense that their members become increasingly unhappy. Successful communities promote functional relationships that contribute to thehappinessof their members.happinessEffective real-world communities are characterized by politeness and civility. In cohesive local communities, individuals greet their neighbors, even if they do not know them. Why do they do this? What is the point of strangers repeatedly greeting each other and making polite conversation? Doing so establishes that we care about each other as members of a cohesive local community. Such relationships may remain superficial but they could also be a starting point for deeper connections.Social media are run by engagement algorithms that operate very differently from a local community. Indeed they turn the rules of civil societies upside down.Successful real-world communities contribute to the happiness and well-being of their members. The opposite consequences are derived from social media. Why is that?One can begin with the basic design of these different communities and how they are accomplished. Real-world communities are designed to minimize conflict. They begin with universal civility towards strangers. Members practice personal modesty, or humility, and are hesitant to blow their own trumpets. If an individual violates these basic rules of politeness and modesty, they are rebuked by others, or are punished by being ignored, or excluded.Social media operate very differently. Their algorithms are designed to maximize attention that is monetized throughadvertising, for example. The algorithms use outrage to gin up user interest. Instead of promoting peace and harmony, social media platforms monetize hate. This is not a careless choice of words: There are numerous examples of social platforms fomenting violence, such as the Facebook-mediatedgenocide in Myanmarand the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol.advertisinggenocide in MyanmarUp to now, social media companies have been shielded by freedom-of-expression principles in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Hopefully that situation is about to change, particularly in Europe.If the engagement algorithm turns the ruling principles of society upside down, we should not be surprised that this results in societal chaos and severe psychological problems at the individual level (2).Three examples make this case: the impact of violentpornographyon relations between the sexes; eating disorders and social media; and the reemergence of far-right hatepolitics.pornographypoliticsAfter children receive smartphones at around 10 years of age, many may be subsequently exposed to a realm of violent pornography. This trend has been accompanied by an apparent increase insexual violenceperpetrated by adolescent boys against their girlfriends. When adolescent girls are exposed to online information about losing weight on platforms like Instagram that often emphasize extreme slenderness, many will change their own eating habits and put themselves at greater risk of developing eating disorders.sexual violenceHow Social Media Impacts Psychiatric SymptomsCan Facebook Facilitate Relationship Reconciliation?Further, the rise of far-right parties that spread hate speech has been linked to the popularity of short-video propaganda on TikTok, particularly as viewed by young people. One good example of this is AfD, once a fringe party but now one of the most popular in Germany, with unprecedented support among young people.There is little doubt that social media are harmful to users. The case for controlling them parallels that of tobacco.Social media are harmful in the sense that the more time people spend online, the worse their mental health is. There is a dose-response relationship. Are social media addictive? There are two kinds of evidence that social media are (3). One is that young people who grow up using them spend increasing amounts of time online and have trouble putting their smartphones down, even when conducting a conversation. Social media use also cuts into sleep time, suggesting a worseaddictionthan tobacco. Dopaminergic systems that underlie drug addiction have been implicated.addictionIn addition to the behavioral evidence assembled by psychologists, we know from whistle-blower Frances Haugen that the Facebook algorithm was designed to keep users hooked.If something is harmful and addictive, it needs to be controlled by governments. This has begun in Europe and elsewhere with the closing of social media membership to adolescents. Doing so should produce many beneficial social consequences, including reduced conflict between the sexes, lessdisordered eatingamong adolescents, and a calming of hate speech and political division.disordered eating

3 Relationship Patterns That Often Lead to Breakups
--- Data ---
“It wasn’t one big fight. No cheating. No screaming. But, somehow, we drifted apart.” This is how many relationships end—they unravel silently. It’s not always obvious betrayals or explosive arguments that push couples apart. Sometimes, it’s smaller, unnoticed patterns that do the most damage—for instance, a sarcastic comment brushed off as a joke or unspoken expectations that fuel resentment.What’s dangerous about these patterns is how they can fly under the radar for years. They don’t cause immediate chaos but slowly chip away at the foundation of your relationship—often before either partner notices.Here are four such patterns that, if left unnoticed, can lead to couples eventually breaking up.Imagine this: You know that something feels off, but your partner insists they’re fine. Maybe they’re giving you short answers, avoiding eye contact, or “forgetting” to do that thing you asked—again. These are signs of passive-aggressive behavior, where unspoken resentment simmers beneath the surface, quietly eroding connection.Passiveaggressionoften stems from a combination of hostility and a learned avoidance of direct conflict. A 2022studyhighlights that while passive-aggressive behavior may not always be overtly hostile, it often masks deep-seated feelings of resentment and dissatisfaction.aggressionstudyThe study emphasizes thatpassive-aggressioncan develop in individuals who grew up in environments where expressing anger wasn’t safe or acceptable, leading them to adopt indirect ways of communicating frustration. It often shows up when:passive-aggressionThe key to overcoming passive-aggression is creating a space where honesty feels safe. Start by recognizing when frustration is being indirectly communicated and challenge yourself to speak up before resentment builds.Practice saying what you need directly:Acknowledge emotions without blame:If you’re on the receiving end, encourageopenness:opennessScorekeeping often starts small—mentally noting who paid for dinner last or who initiated the last date—but it can snowball into deeper feelings of imbalance and unfairness. And when these feelings go unspoken, they quietly chip away at the relationship, creating a divide that’s hard to bridge.Why Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsHere are some examples of what scorekeeping can look like in a relationship:Tracking chores and responsibilities:Measuring emotional investment:Comparing acts of love:Keeping tabs on apologies:A 2019studypublished in theJournal of Social and Personal Relationshipsfound that couples with a high “exchange orientation”—a tendency to keep score—experienced lowerintimacyon days where they had conflict.

5 Ways to Communicate With Power and Confidence
--- Data ---
Powerful communication is a cornerstone ofleadership, influence, and success. Yet, for many women, finding and using their voice withconfidencecan be a challenge. Whether you're in the boardroom, leading a team,negotiating a deal, or simply advocating for yourself, the way you communicate matters. Here are five key ways to communicate with power and confidence.leadershipconfidencenegotiating a dealYour voice is one of the most powerful tools you have. Speak with clarity, conviction, and purpose. Avoid minimising language like "just," "sorry," or "I think" when you don’t need to. Instead of saying, "I just wanted to check if this works," say, "Let’s move forward with this approach." When you own your voice, you project confidence and credibility.Research shows that women are more likely than men to usehedging languagein professional settings, which can undermine their authority. Becoming aware of these speech patterns is the first step in shifting toward a more powerful communication style.hedging languageTry this:Payattentionto your language this week. Remove unnecessary qualifiers and practice speaking with directness and certainty. Your voice is one of the most powerful tools you have. Speak with clarity, conviction, and purpose. When you own your voice, you project confidence and credibility.Try this:attentionSilence is just as powerful as words. Instead of filling the space with unnecessary explanations, allow pauses to emphasise key points. The "power pause" not only makes your words land with impact but also signals confidence and control. If you’re asked a tough question, take a moment before responding—this shows thoughtfulness and presence rather than rushing to fill the silence.Michelle Obama is known for her powerful use of pauses in speeches. She takes deliberate moments to let her words resonate, making her message even more impactful. Pausing allows your audience to absorb your message and shows that you are in control of the conversation.Try this:In your next conversation, pause before responding. Notice how it shifts the energy and strengthens your presence. Silence is just as powerful as words. Instead of filling the space with unnecessary explanations, allow pauses to emphasise key points.Try this:Communication isn’t just about words—it’s about how you carry yourself. Stand tall, use open gestures, and maintain strong (but not overpowering) eye contact. Avoid small, hesitant movements that can diminish your presence. A firm handshake, a grounded stance, and a steady gaze reinforce your authority and make your words more powerful.I once worked with a leader who transformed her presence simply by shifting herbody language. She went from folding her arms and looking down during meetings to standing tall, making eye contact, and using confident gestures. Almost immediately, her colleagues responded differently—she was perceived as more authoritative, and her contributions were taken more seriously.body languageCultivating ConfidenceTake our Assertiveness TestFind a Self Esteem TherapistTry this:Practice power posing for two minutes before your next big meeting or conversation. Notice how it changes your confidence level.Try this:Many women unconsciously soften their language with unnecessary apologies or qualifiers. Instead of saying, "I’m not sure if this is right, but…" say, "Here’s my perspective on this." Powerful communicators remove the doubt from their language and stand firmly in their expertise. If you need to apologise, do so with sincerity, but don’t make it a habit when it’s not warranted.Studies have shown that women tend to apologise more frequently than men, even when no wrongdoing has occurred.Researchby Schumann and Ross found that women’s higherapologyrate is linked to their perception of what constitutes offensive behavior, not a greater tendency to make mistakes. Becoming aware of this pattern can help women step into their authority more confidently.Researchapology9 Daily Practices to Build Up Your Self-ConfidenceThe Confidence Code: 3 Ways to Project (and Attain) SuccessTry this:The next time you catch yourself overapologising, pause and reframe your statement with confidence.Try this:Powerful communication isn’t about domination—it’s about connection. Whether speaking to a room of executives or having a one-on-one conversation, engage with your audience. Listen actively, ask thoughtful questions, and make your message relevant to them. When people feel heard and understood, your words carry even more weight.Oprah Winfrey is a master of connection. She makes her audience feel seen, heard, and valued by listening intently and responding with empathy. This ability to connect deeply has made her one of the most influential communicators in the world.Try this:In your next conversation, focus on listening more than speaking. Summarise what the other person says before responding to deepen connection.Try this:Communicating with power isn’t about being the loudest person in the room—it’s about being the most intentional, clear, and confident. Your voice matters. Your message matters. When you own your power in communication, you create space for yourself and for other women to rise.How will you start communicating with more power today?

When Your Mind Won't Let It Go
--- Data ---
You’re trying to fall asleep, but your brain keeps replaying that awkward comment you made at work. Or maybe it’s a breakup, a mistake, or something you wish you’d done differently. You tell yourself to move on; you really want to. But, somehow, your mind refuses to drop it.If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. The unending wheel of rumination is incredibly common—and incredibly frustrating. But why do we do it? Why is it so hard to let things go, even when we know it’s not helping? And, most importantly, what can we do about it?Rumination is the process of continuously thinking about the same thoughts—often negative ones—over and over again. It’s different from reflection, which is more balanced and purposeful. While reflection can lead to insight, rumination tends to go in circles and leaves us feeling stuck, anxious, or hopeless.There are two main types of rumination. Brooding is when you passively focus on your distress. You have thoughts about why something happened, how it was unfair, or what you think you did to cause the issue. Reflection is more focused on problem-solving—you are trying to figure out the situation so you can make different choices in the future. The brooding type of rumination causes us the most distress and can lead todepression,anxiety, andinsomnia(Zhang et al., 2024).depressionanxietyinsomniaOur brains are problem-solving machines, and rumination often starts with good intentions. We want to learn from a mistake, prepare for the future, or protect ourselves from emotional pain. But when those intentions turn into obsessive loops, we cross over into rumination.Some of the most common psychological reasons we ruminate include:Perfectionism:A desire to get things “just right” can lead to overanalyzing everything you said or did.Perfectionism:PerfectionismFearof uncertainty:If you struggle with uncertainty, your brain may keep replaying a scenario in search of control.Fearof uncertainty:FearLowself-worth:If you tend to believe negative things about yourself, your mind may latch onto mistakes as “proof.”Lowself-worth:self-worthTraumaor past invalidation:If you grew up in an environment where your feelings weren’t acknowledged, your brain might try to process pain long after the moment has passed.Traumaor past invalidation:TraumaNeurological:Research shows that people prone to rumination have increased activity in thedefault mode network(DMN) of the brain, including the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (Martinez-Vispo et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2020). The DMN is active when we’re not focused on the outside world (when our mind is wandering).Neurological:default mode networkTelling someone to “just let it go” is like telling someone with anxiety to “just relax.” It’s not that simple. Rumination makes us feel a sense of control or that we’re working toward a solution—except we rarely find one. Instead of helping us, rumination keeps us in our heads and out of the present moment, where actual change can happen.The good news? Rumination is a habit—and, like any habit, it can be interrupted. Here are some strategies that can help:Recognize it:Use a disruptor:mindfulnessattentionPractice self-compassion:inner voiceShift to action:Considertherapy:therapytherapy with a mental health professionalcognitive behavioralWhat Is Anxiety?Take our Generalized Anxiety Disorder TestFind a therapist to overcome anxietyIt’s easy to beat yourself up for not being able to “let it go.” But rumination is a very human (and normal) response to pain and uncertainty. It’s not a personal failing; it’s a pattern that can be changed with practice and support. Treat yourself with compassion.Copyright 2025 Sarkis Media LLCCopyright 2025 Sarkis Media LLC

ADHD Productivity Trap: Stop Being Busy, Start Doing
--- Data ---
For adults withattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), staying busy doesn’t always mean being productive. You might spend hours answering emails, shuffling papers, switching between tasks—but at the end of the day, It feels like nothing really got done. This is the ADHDproductivitytrap: constant motion without meaningful progress.attentionADHDproductivityIt’s exhausting. And, worse, it chips away at yourconfidence.confidenceThe ADHD brain struggles with prioritization, sequencing tasks, and holding goals in workingmemory. That means it’s easy to mistake urgency for importance, to jump into doing what’s right in front of you, or to fall into avoidance when overwhelmed. Over time, this creates a cycle of starting without finishing, feeling disorganized, and feeling bad about yourself for it.memoryBut it doesn’t have to stay that way.Escaping the productivity trap begins with understanding how your brain works and building systems that support your focus, not fight it.One of the most effective strategies is to create a structure around your work. Structure gives you a container for your time. Without it, everything feels like it needs to happen at once. The ADHD brain thrives with external cues, so setting specific blocks of time for particular kinds of work can help you start and stay on task. Even if you don’t always follow your schedule perfectly, having that roadmap reduces decision fatigue and makes it easier to get back on track when your attention drifts.Another essential shift is learning to prioritize. Most people with ADHD don’t naturally rank tasks. Everything feels equally urgent. This leads to wasted effort and unfinished priorities. Instead of relying on mental to-do lists, try writing out your daily tasks and picking one high-impact task to complete first. Even better, identify your “nonnegotiables” the night before. This way, you wake up already knowing what matters most.Avoid multitasking. It might feel productive, but it scatters your focus and slows you down. The ADHD brain can be especially vulnerable to context switching—jumping from one thing to another without finishing anything. When you sit down to work, permit yourself to do just one thing at a time. Set a timer for 25 or 45 minutes, and don’t switch tasks until the timer ends. This keeps your focus anchored and builds momentum.It’s also important to factor in breaks. Your brain wasn’t designed to grind all day. Working without breaks leads toburnout, which makes it harder to start the next day. Instead, schedule short breaks to recharge. Go for a walk. Stretch. Eat. Then, come back with renewed focus.burnoutAnother trap is getting stuck in the “busywork loop.” Things like cleaning your desk, responding to low-priority emails, or reorganizing files can feel satisfying in the moment, but they rarely move your big goals forward. These tasks often provide adopaminehit without real progress. Before starting your day, ask yourself:What would actually make me feel accomplished today?Then tackle that first.dopamineWhat would actually make me feel accomplished today?One more powerful strategy is building external accountability. Whether it’s a coach, a friend, or a body double (someone working alongside you), knowing someone is aware of your goals makes it easier to follow through. ADHD often responds well to socialmotivation, so don’t hesitate to enlist support.motivationWhat Is ADHD?Take our ADHD TestFind a therapist to help with ADHDMost importantly, shift your mindset. You’re not broken or lazy. You’re wired differently. The more compassion you show yourself, the more energy you’ll have to build systems that work.You’re not meant to work like everyone else. You’re meant to work likeyou. Once you understand your brain, you can stop chasing productivity like everyone else and start building your own rhythm.youYou can get things done—without burning out, without feeling like you're falling behind, and without constantly questioning your worth.It starts with one change at a time.

Is Selfishness Ever an Option?
--- Data ---
The concept of selfishness has been debated acrossphilosophy, psychology, and biology. Is selfishness inherently destructive, or does it serve a necessary purpose? From an evolutionary perspective, self-interest has been crucial for survival. However, selfish actions can have broad societal implications in an interconnected world. This post explores the roots of selfishness, its role in modern society, and whether ethical selfishness is a viable approach to life.philosophySurvival in the animal kingdom often depends on self-preservation, a trait driven by selfishness. Self-interest is hardwired into the human brain, from securing food to protecting offspring. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution highlights that natural selection favors those who can ensure their survival and reproductive success (Darwin, 1859).Selfish behavior is observed across species. In animal groups, individuals compete for scarce resources, such as food and mates. However, selfishness is often countered by cooperation, as seen in social animals like wolves and primates. Humans have evolved to balance self-interest withcollaboration, leading to the development of complex societies (Tomasello, 2009).collaborationEven in human evolution, selfishgenes, as Richard Dawkins described inThe Selfish Gene, drive behaviors that ensure the continuation of one's genetic lineage. However, paradoxically, cooperation often emerges as a successful evolutionary strategy because groups working together thrive better than isolated individuals (Dawkins, 1976).genesThe Selfish GeneIn contemporary society, selfishness appears in various forms, from corporate rivalry to personal ambition. For instance, capitalism operates on the principle that individuals pursuing their self-interest contribute to economic development. Entrepreneurs and businesses innovate and grow mainly to achieve profit; however, their efforts can also create jobs and enhance living standards (Smith, 1776).However, unregulated selfishness can lead to social inequality, environmental destruction, and ethical dilemmas. The 2008 financial crisis, fueled by unchecked corporate greed, demonstrated how extreme selfishness can harm society. Similarly,climate changehighlights the consequences of excessive resource consumption driven by self-interest.climate changeSocial mediahas added a new layer to this discussion. The pursuit of personal brand growth, followers, and influence often encouragesnarcissisticbehaviors that can erode genuine social connections. Studies show that constant self-promotion online can negatively affect mental health and increase feelings of isolation (Twenge & Campbell, 2009).Social medianarcissisticSelfishness can sometimes be essential on a personal level. Prioritizing mental health, establishingboundaries, or concentrating on personal growth necessitates self-interest. However, when taken to extremes, it can alienate loved ones and fracture a community.boundariesAyn Rand's philosophy of objectivism promotes rational self-interest, arguing that ethical selfishness leads to a more productive and fulfilling life. This perspective suggests that prioritizing oneself can indirectly benefit society—successful, fulfilled individuals contribute more positively to their communities.Ethical selfishness involves considering long-term consequences and balancing self-interest with collective well-being. While a company adopting sustainable practices may incur short-term costs, it secures long-term profitability while benefiting society. Similarly, individuals practicing self-care ensure they are mentally and physically capable of supporting others.Evolutionary PsychologyWhy That Fetus Looks Just Like DaddyWhy the Baby Bust Is Our Biggest ProblemSelfishness can be a beneficial force when approached with awareness andethics. While evolution has ingrained self-interest into human nature, modern society requires balancing personal ambition and collective responsibility. The key is distinguishing between destructive selfishness and ethical self-interest. Thus, selfishness can be an option—when it is conscious, rational, and considerate of broader societal implications.ethics

The Joys of Doing Citizen Science With Wild Neighbors
--- Data ---
I'm a huge fan of citizen science.1In my own work on the behavior of dogs, for example, I learn an incredible amount from people who carefully observe their dogs and send me wonderful stories and videos, often accompanied by important questions about what their dog is doing and why. I also was thrilled when a woman in Chicago became an expert on the birds and insects living in her rooftop garden and formed an urban rewilding club after readingRewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and Coexistence. These are among the reasons I was thrilled to learn of Dr. Menno Schilthuizen's new bookThe Urban Naturalist: How to Make the City Your Scientific Playground. Here's what he had to say about his most timely book.Rewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and CoexistenceRewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and CoexistenceThe Urban Naturalist: How to Make the City Your Scientific PlaygroundThe Urban Naturalist: How to Make the City Your Scientific PlaygroundMarc Bekoff: Why did you writeThe Urban Naturalist?Marc Bekoff: Why did you writeThe Urban NaturalistThe Urban Naturalist?Menno Schilthuizen:The book really has been the confluence of several trends—some scientific and social, others very much personal. To start with the latter, I have come to realize that despite my long professionalcareerin scientific institutions, at heart I am still that wide-eyed schoolboy in his room excitedly messing about with pinned bugs, chemical equipment, anddreamsof explorations. That is how I started out and I have always tried to stay true to those early, deep-rooted motivations. At the same time, because I do a lot of science communication, and run a foundation for citizen science, I have come to realize that that romantic image of science as pure discovery is also what attracts the general public to take up science-leaning hobbies and pursuits. And the time is right: One by one, all the obstacles that in the 20th century stood in the way of amateur scientists to really contribute to science in a meaningful way, are falling away.Menno Schilthuizen:careerdreamsThe scientific literature is available online for everybody; databases with genetic, environmental, biodiversity, and geographic information are free to access and use; scientific equipment, if it isn’t already inside your smartphone, can be bought on eBay for little money; and university-leveleducationcan be had by anybody via the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that most universities offer free of charge. And, finally, I am convinced that the city is where these new naturalists can do their most exciting discoveries. The urban ecosystem is novel, global, and is developing simultaneously though the actions of a single species (Homo sapiens)—something that has never happened in the history of life on earth. And urban naturalists are smack in the middle of it to watch it all happen.educationHomo sapiensMB: How does your book relate to your background and general areas of interest?MB: How does your book relate to your background and general areas of interest?MS:What I try to do in the book are two things.

I talk about the whole lab of equipment that is in your smartphone, but also about community labs and how to build your own natural history collection (including theethicsof taking specimens for science).MS:ethicsSecond, I hope to show the ecology of the urban ecosystem: In what ways is nature in the city different and in what way is it the same as "wild" ecosystems? My background is in studying wild ecosystems but in the past 15 years I have become fascinated by city nature. Partly because urban ecosystems are so different from natural ones: road-kill, light pollution, human food, impervious surfaces—none of these exist outside of cities and urban flora and fauna is constantly challenged by them, sometimes driving them to rapid evolution. But partly also because, surprisingly, they are so similar. For example, isolated greenspaces in cities are, ecologically speaking, no different from wild oceanic islands. There are caves and crevices in the city where you can be an urban speleologist. And in the gutter we find the miniature equivalent of a rainforest.MB: Who do you hope to reach?MB: Who do you hope to reach?MS:I hope to reach anybody living in an urbanized environment (and that is the majority of the world’s people) who has a bit of child-like curiosity and wonder left inside of them. I hope I can help them rekindle that spark and become an explorer of their own world. The city is full of nature, as long as you have an eye for it. City dwellers often feel disconnected from nature, and think nature is something you see on TV or you need to travel far to reach. By realizing that true, exciting nature is all around them, even (or especially) in the heart of the city where they live, they will reconnect with nature, enjoy all the health benefits that exposure to nature is known to bring, and hopefully also begin protecting and defending cherished bits of neighborhood natureMS:MB: What are some of the major topics you consider?MB: What are some of the major topics you consider?MS:Two important topics are the following:MS:The joy of collecting.

I also discuss the ethics of killing organisms for research and ways to still build a collection if you would not harm a fly.The joy of collectingchildhoodEvolutionary traps. The ecology of the city is full of unprecedented, unintentional, and unexpected causes of mortality for animals and plants that are just begging to be studied by urban naturalists. One example is that flying freshwater insects and birds are killed in huge numbers because they are attracted to the circularly polarized light bouncing of smooth human-made surfaces, like car roofs, tarmac roads, and solar panels. For millions of years, circularly polarized light was a sure sign of water bodies—but not anymore. Another example is discarded bottles andcansthat small rodents mistake for a burrow and get trapped in.Evolutionary trapscansMB: Are you hopeful that as people learn more about urban animals and their homes they will be more likely to leave them be?MB: Are you hopeful that as people learn more about urban animals and their homes they will be more likely to leave them be?MS:Yes, the problem is that people always want to “do something." We tend to think that nature conservation should involve a lot of activity: planting, fencing, weeding, controlling. But to me the spontaneity and dynamism, without any top-down control, is the hallmark of nature. And nature conservation, especially in cities, is just a matter of actively doing nothing and simply watching ecosystems unfold themselves.MS:

If You Think Growing Older Isn’t Funny, Think Again
--- Data ---
It has been proposed that there is nothing certain in life except death and taxes. That said, as someone who has been studyinglaughterandhumoron and off for nearly 30 years, I would suggest that only slightly less certain are jokes about growing older. In fact, almost everything about the process of aging seems to lend itself to humor.laughterhumorAs the author of this blog, I am compelled to spend hour after hour in front of my computer looking at videos that make me smile and laugh. I’m constantly on the lookout for certain patterns that will help my readers better understand the means by which comedians solicit laughter. One such pattern became obvious recently. You’ve probably noticed it, too, but just didn’t give it much thought. That is, virtually every comic of any reputation, at some point, touches on the trials experienced as one gets older. If they are young (in their 20s), they might reference their parents, uncles, aunts, bosses, landlords, American political leaders (especially these last nine years), or just a random elderly person they recently encountered. If the comedian is over the age of 30 (and definitely if they are over 40), they will more times than not give a first-person account of the downsides (or rarely the benefits) of getting on in age.So why are age and aging a go-to topic for humorists? According to theMutual Vulnerability Theory of Laughter, it has a lot to do with the changes we experience as most of us reach our 30s and 40s, and, of course, the decades beyond. Yes, there are plenty of exceptions, but, in general, we tend to become less physically active, have more limited endurance, and take longer to recover fromstressfulexercise. We find our sense of balance and strength are not what they once were. Our eyesight and hearing are less acute. Our bones become more brittle, our cartilage gets thinner, and our height slowly diminishes. Our digestive system may not be able to handle the same foods as reliably as it once did. It takes longer to bounce back after injuries and illness, and though we once were able to pull “all-nighters” with ease, we now struggle to keep alert after 10 p.m.Mutual Vulnerability Theory of LaughterstressfulBeyond these sorts of physical vulnerabilities, we also see changes in our emotional and cognitive abilities. The things we loved to do when we were young are less available to us, so our passion for life can sometimes falter. Playtime becomes harder to come by. We have the aggravations of work and family to contend with. We take on more responsibilities, more possessions, more things to keep track of, but, sadly, ourmemoryisn’t what it once was.memorySocially, we sometimes find our peak years slipping behind us as well. We are more settled, our lives more predictable, andcareeradvancements are much less frequent. Our sports car or motorcycle is now a station wagon or SUV. Our speed boat now has pontoons. We may not get the admiring looks we once did, and our friends no longer come “with benefits.”careerAll these changes come at a cost. Where we once inhabited the realm of “normal,” we now become saddled with one vulnerability after another. Ourgoalsbecome harder to reach, and, as a result, almost every aspect of our lives becomes fodder forhumor. Sometimes, we point out these changes.goalshumorSometimes, they are highlighted by others. Either way, they represent the sort of setbacks most of our contemporaries can relate to. A little dig here, a dad joke there, an embarrassing anecdote that goes on a bit longer than you’d like…there are bound to be at least some knowing smiles and, if you’re lucky, plenty of sympathetic "lifting laughter" from friends and family.As George Bernard Shaw once observed, “You don’t stop laughing when you grow old. You grow old when you stop laughing.”I’ve gathered a few examples from both well-known stand-up comedians and one very clever amateur.

Transforming Conflict Into Connection
--- Data ---
Conflict often has a negative connotation, associated with arguments, discomfort, and emotional pain. However, beneath this challenging situation, one can find an invaluable opportunity. Conflict, when approached consciously, can become a powerful offering—an invitation to learn about ourselves, uncover hidden truths, and strengthen our capacity for love.Conflict is not a problem to be “dealt with” but rather a gift waiting to be opened with care. As a couple therapist who helps couples with conflict resolution, I have learned that harmony never grows out of avoiding conflict or sweeping it under the rug. True peace arises from seeing conflict as a natural catalyst for growth, prompting us to uncover hidden truths about ourselves and our relationships. Once we realize how much we could gain from each conflict, our whole outlook on life’s conflicts change for the better.Conflict makes us uncomfortable because it confronts us with realities that oppose our needs, desires, or expectations. Rather than avoiding this discomfort, leaning into it can foster emotionalresilience, compassion, and a greater capacity for love. Every challenging interaction becomes an invitation to question our belief system, to strengthen our emotional and relational skills, and to promote growth beyond our comfort zones.resilienceConflicts typically stem from deeper, oftenunconsciousaspects of ourselves known as our "shadow." These hidden elements—our insecurities, fears, and unresolved wounds—surface during conflicts. By consciously exploring these shadows, we facilitate personal healing and reintegration, paving the way toward emotional freedom andauthenticity. It allows us to express our true selves with all their colors with compassion, love, andcreativity.unconsciousauthenticitycreativityCounterintuitively, conflict can deepenintimacyand trust. When partners engage with conflicts openly, honestly, and respectfully, they reveal their true selves, fostering mutual understanding and emotional safety. Vulnerability during conflict communicates commitment, respect, and sincere care, reinforcing a bond of authentic connection.intimacyConflict provides clarity about our needs, desires, andboundaries. Expressing these openly empowers both individuals to create a relationship reflecting their deeper values and identities. Every time we resolve conflict with awareness andopenness, it moves us toward a mature, fulfilling, and lasting love.boundariesopennessCouples typically manage conflicts in one of three ways, each illustrated through the following scenario:Scenario:Alex seeks more independence and social activities outside the relationship, while Jordan desires more shared quality time.Scenario:Win-lose approach:guiltCompromise approach:Synergy (synthesis) approach:collaborationWhy Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsTo achieve synthesis, we must recognize conflict as a call for internal growth rather than merely external disagreement. By exploring conflicts at a deeper level, partners uncover and heal unconscious wounds and repressed desires shaped by past conditioning. This deeper awareness creates profound relational freedom and emotional maturity.Conflicts often revolve around seemingly contradictory values like freedom versus security, stability versus adventure, or comfort versus growth. Rather than setting restrictive rules or compromises, synergy involves exploring how conflict can push each partner toward greater unity and mutual expansion.When Sameness Betrays FairnessWhy Do We Hold on to Old Flames?1. Look beneath the surface1. Look beneath the surfaceLiving life fully starts with personal responsibility and self-reflection. During conflict, pause to identify deeper feelings and needs beneath immediate reactions. Ask yourself: "What part of me is triggered?" or "What deeper longing am I avoiding through defensiveness or demands?" Recognizing these underlying truths transforms conflict into self-awareness, healing, and relational depth.2. Transform emotional energy into a positive force2. Transform emotional energy into a positive forceConflict generates intense emotional energy that can be constructively harnessed and redirected. Rather than suppressing these feelings through rigid agreements, you can creatively shift negative emotions into positive power, transforminganxietyinto excitement, frustration intomotivation, orangerinto passion. By consciously channeling emotional intensity into deeper understanding and growth, you build new and more profound levels of connection, trust, and intimacy.anxietymotivationanger3. Hold space in sacred wonder3. Hold space in sacred wonderInstead of immediately seeking solutions or compromises, cultivate openness, curiosity, and courage for creating deeper intimacy through synergy. Allow room for uncertainty, viewing conflict as a shared opportunity rather than a threat. This "sacred wonder" encourages emotional vulnerability and creative exploration, enabling unexpected paths and synergetic solutions to emerge naturally, building stronger connections and mutual growth.Ultimately, viewing conflict as an opportunity for growth transforms challenges into powerful learning experiences. Each conflict encourages self-reflection, emotional honesty, and relational development, turning discomfort into a profound personal and mutual improvement. Embracing conflict consciously allows couples to build stronger, deeper relationships and become more compassionate, resilient, and authentic individuals.

Boys and Belonging: Don’t Leave It to Online Influencers

All teenagers are actively asking, “Who am I?” and, “Where do I belong?” These aren’t abstract curiosities; they’re core developmental tasks. The answers are shaped by family, culture, mentors, and peers. Increasingly, influencers, algorithms, and peer dynamics online also play a significant role. If we don’t create healthy spaces for boys and young men to explore these questions, someone else will—often with a much more rigid, reactive, and sometimesdangerousscript.dangerousAdolescenceThe show follows a 13-year-old boy whoseidentityand behaviors are shaped in significant ways by online extremism, revealing how toxic ideologies can have devastating consequences.

How Vocational Similarity Sparks Romance
--- Data ---
For singles, the workplace is an evergreen dating ground. A place to meet like-minded peers in a relaxed, comfortable, familiar environment. No set-ups, restaurant reservations, or off-hours investment of time. The workplace also allows potential paramours to observe each other in a natural habitat—usually displaying both personality and professional proficiency.Even when couples don’t meet in the same workplace, however, it turns out certain types of vocational similarity predict better successful relationships. That is why a great conversation topic early on when exploring a potential dating relationship continues to be what each prospective partner does for a living. And although you don’t need to date someone with the exact same type of job to boost relational quality, certain types of interests attract. Research explains.In Labor and LoveGiven the time we spend in the workplace, ideally, we like what we do. Yet even if we work to live not live to work, our occupation often reflects our personality—capitalizing on personal and professional preferences. Kristel Mayrand et al. (2023) explored which types of vocational personality types are better together.[i][i]Studying a sample of 104 cohabiting couples, they found that a higher degree of vocational similarity was linked with higher couple adjustment and relational stability, particularly between partners who were similar in specific vocational personality types.Mayrand et al. recognize six vocational personality types conceptualized by prior research: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. Of the six, they found couple vocational similarity predicted more successful relationships between partners who were similar on the Artistic or Enterprising type. They describe the Artistic type as seeking creative, unsystematized, or ambiguous activities as writing, reading, music, acting, and visual art. They describe Artistic people as intuitive, unconventional, open, and imaginative. Enterprisingpersonality typepartners enjoy activities involvingleadershipandpersuasion. Not surprisingly, they are described as ambitious, self-confident, sociable,extraverted, and domineering.personality typeleadershippersuasionextravertedMayrand et al. conclude that vocational similarity between romantic partners is due primarily tomatingpreferences, yet also found that the extent to which vocational similarity contributed to couple adjustment and relational stability depended on the partners’ vocational personality types. Explaining the dynamic, Mayrand et al. noted that people with higher levels of Artistic type vocational personalities can enjoy freely expressing their unconventional nature together without criticism, and Enterprising vocational personality types can choose a romantic partner similar to themselves with whom to share a lavish lifestyle. Accordingly, Mayrand et al. conclude that mutual vocational competencies and interests appear to assist in cultivating and maintaining well-adjustedromantic relationships.matingromantic relationshipsBetter TogetherPractically speaking, many couples can relate to the reality that similar personality traits coupled with shared professional pursuits can not only make for interesting conversation but also build common ground. New acquaintances getting to know each other are accordingly well advised to explore what each other does for a living, as well as what they enjoy about the job. In both work and in play, rapport builds romance as well-matched partners celebrate mutual interests and pursue commongoalsboth professionally and personally.goalsWhat Is Personality?Take our Agreeableness TestFind a therapist near me

Daily Practice Is the Key to Brain Injury Recovery
--- Data ---
Toddlers practice toilet training. Some young children practice cursive writing while others practice riding a bike. Teens practice problem solving and essay skills through daily homework. But as established adults, we don’t expect to have to practice basic skills, whether cognitive or motor.After brain injury, that changes.“The goal of repetitive task training is to practice particular motor functions repeatedly and consistently. This method facilitates the reacquisition of motor skills by encouraging synapse strengthening and cortical reorganization. Both [Constraint-Induced MovementTherapyand Repetitive Task Training] emphasize the idea of experience-dependent neuroplasticity and show promise for enhancing the results of rehabilitation.” (Zotey et al, 2023.)TherapyZotey et al, 2023Practice—that is, repetitive training—matters in healing brain injury. My first psychologist told me that when I don’t practice reading, my brain returns to its default state: The injured state. Not the pre-brain injury state.In 2002,Carey et alstudied intensive finger tracking training in 10 chronic stroke subjects. This training lead to significant improvement in finger dexterity in these individuals.Carey et al“We concluded that individuals with chronic stroke receiving intensive tracking training showed improved tracking accuracy and grasp and release function, and that these improvements were accompanied by brain reorganization.”Repetitive training is like my advanced high-school math class. The teacher taught class for five, ten minutes tops. The rest of the time we solved problems in the textbook, either getting help from classmates or from him. It was supervised practice in school instead of unsupervised practice (homework) at home. I received my highest marks in that class.It’s one thing to practice new math skills in school or writing skills at home; it’s another to relearn what one had long mastered.I learnt that practice doesn’t work for cognitive skills until the damaged neurons andneuralnetworks are treated with neurostimulation therapies.neuralIt’s frustrating and grieving trying to regain reading and writing withoutneurostimulation or neuromodulation.neurostimulation or neuromodulationIt’s easy to give up. Left to their natural healing speed, damaged neurons and neural networks regenerate at a glacial pace and learning doesn’t stick. Just as a child must practice over and over, so must an adult with brain injury—not just for a few days or weeks; but for months and years.Having someone in your corner keeps you encouraged and persisting through the endless months. But what if you don’t have that person, someone to ensure you practice?After my eye surgery, my brain had to relearn how to perceive and see with 3D binocular vision. As I wrote in my book,Concussion Is Brain Injury: Treating the Neurons and Me:Concussion Is Brain Injury: Treating the Neurons and MeMy eye surgeon advised me “to practice using my eyes in walking, reading, using the computer, etc. Practice would get me back to independence. Movement, of myself, people, dogs, or cars would be the last thing my brain would adapt to.I had no one to practice with. In my home, I could hang on to my walls. Outside…Take our Memory TestFind a therapist near meEventually, I received virtual help for walking practice along withgamma-brainwave trainingand using prescribed neuromodulation 15 minutes ahead of practice time. I improved.gamma-brainwave trainingFor a time, I received virtual help with reading practice as well. I’d read over the phone to someone; sometimes they’d read to me. But my reading comprehension didn’t progress much that way. I continued to struggle to the point that I gave up in 2018; that’s when I learned about Lindamood-Bell’sVisualizing and Verbalizingprogram.Visualizing and VerbalizingAfter I completed my reading comprehension retraining at Lindamood-Bell, I received virtual support by phone to practice my relearned reading comprehension. Unlike up to 2018, where I read over the phone to another, this time I was encouraged to read for five minutes on my own if I hadn’t already. Gradually, I built up my reading practice time.Traumatic Brain InjuryTraumatic Brain Injuries in the Modern AgeFixing the Gut-Brain Chaos After Head InjuryToday, I practice on my own, setting loose reading-levelgoals—for example, read easy, light, and short novels then move on to easy but more complex mysteries—or physical goals such as reading on a Kobo Libra H2O with text enlarged to shrinking the text size to reading paperbacks. I also monitor how long I read in one go or over the day.goalsVideo calls may provide better support. Like virtual write-ins where writers gather together through video to write silently for a set number of minutes then discuss for a few minutes before writing again, virtual read-ins could provide tangible real-time support. It also normalizes the experience so that you don’t feel the sting of having to relearn a cherished skill.Almost seven years after I regained reading comprehension, I continue to practice it. The only time I omit daily reading is when I’m writing or revising a novel. I find the cognitive load of creating a fictional story prevents me from reading, no matter how light the novel. At best, I may be able to read for less than 15 minutes one day in the month I write. Until you suffer a brain injury, you don’t realize how complex a cognitive skill reading is and how much energy your brain requires to use it.Is all the effort worth it?Yes, when you receive neurostimulation therapy upon which you can build daily practice. You experience permanent, dramatic improvement after the therapy. Practice not only lets you retain that improvement, it increases it over time.Practice then turns into a daily habit.In a way, that’s how you can rebuild a lifestyle you used to enjoy. Perhaps it’s daily walks in a local park. Or starting each morning with coffee and a newspaper. Or maybe it’s journaling nightly. Whatever it is you yearn to regain, daily practice is the key to getting there.Copyright ©2025 Shireen Anne JeejeebhoyCopyright ©2025 Shireen Anne Jeejeebhoy

Social Diabetes: Is Digital Connection Making Us Sick?
--- Data ---
A New Language for a New SyndromeA New Language for a New SyndromeWe need better language for the pathologies of modern life. A concept I call social diabetes gives us a framework for understanding why we feel so emotionally unwell in a time of unprecedented connectivity. It’s not that we’re alone, it’s that we’re overdosing on connection in a form our brains were never designed to process.It’s time to restore relationalnutritionto our lives. Not every ping is a person. Not every follow is a friend. And not every comment is communication.nutritionThe Sugar of the SoulThe Sugar of the SoulConnection is as essential to our psychological survival as glucose is to our physical body. Human beings evolved in small, attuned communities where emotional contact, mutual recognition, and physical presence were our lifeblood. But in the modern era, we are flooded with social input—an endless stream of comments, messages, reactions, likes, matches, followers, and filters.Like sugar, a little bit of social connection is nourishing. But too much, too fast, in too processed a form? That’s where we begin to break down.This is the basis of social diabetes: the psychological condition that results from the overconsumption of social connectedness through digital platforms, leading to emotional dysregulation, diminished self-worth, superficial relationships, and an ever-widening social divide.What Is Social Diabetes?What Is Social Diabetes?Social diabetes is not a recognized diagnosis, but it describes a recognizable syndrome caused by the overavailability and overstimulation of social interaction. It’s not caused by isolation or disconnection, but paradoxically, by too much connection in the wrong form.Where relationalintimacyonce required time, presence, and emotional risk, digital platforms offer instant access without vulnerability. Social needs are met with fast, sugary hits: likes instead of eye contact, emojis instead of empathy, comments instead of conversation.intimacyThe result: Emotional blood sugar spikes—dopaminergic surges from digital feedback—followed by psychological crashes ofanxiety, numbness, andshame. Over time, we become dysregulated, fatigued, and alienated from others and ourselves.anxietyshameThe Symptoms of Social DiabetesThe Symptoms of Social DiabetesPeople suffering from social diabetes may appear constantly “connected,” but underneath the surface, they often report:•Lowself-esteemand a fragile sense of self-worthLowself-esteemself-esteem•Obsessive comparisonto others’ curated livesObsessive comparison•Addictive checking behaviors—scrolling, refreshing, respondingAddictive checking behaviors•Superficial relationships, with fewer deep or emotionally safe bondsSuperficial relationships•A chronic senseof being unseen or misunderstoodA chronic sense•Increased polarization andmistrust, as nuanced dialogue is replaced by tribal performances and echo chambersIncreased polarization andmistrustmistrustNeuroscience: The Hijacking of the Social BrainNeuroscience: The Hijacking of the Social BrainNeuroscienceOur brains evolved in environments where social cues were embodied and sparse—requiring us to interpret facial expression, tone, proximity, and timing. In that environment, social input was metabolized in real-time and in moderation.Today’ssocial mediaenvironment, however, floods the brain with signals. The mesolimbicdopaminesystem, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, lights up when we receive likes or messages—just as it does with sugar,sex, or substances. Over time, this leads to desensitization and a need for more intense stimuli to feel anything.social mediadopaminesexMoreover, chronic digital exposure impairs the prefrontal cortex, responsible for impulse control and reflective thinking, and hyperactivates the amygdala, increasing threat sensitivity. This contributes tosocial anxiety, emotional reactivity, and black-and-white thinking—fertile ground for social divide.social anxietyThe Relational CostThe Relational CostFrom apsychoanalyticperspective,identityis forged through mutual recognition, emotional resonance, and the capacity to be truly known. But digital platforms promote what psychologist Philip Bromberg might call“self-states without context”—snapshots of self that are curated, performative, and often disconnected from embodied experience.psychoanalyticidentity“self-states without context”How Social Media Impacts Psychiatric SymptomsCan Facebook Facilitate Relationship Reconciliation?Instead of attunement, we get audience. Instead of dialogue, we get broadcast. The self becomes a brand. Other people become mirrors, not minds.As a result, real intimacy becomes harder to tolerate. When connection is always available, it stops feeling meaningful. People report being surrounded by others and yet feeling intensely alone.Social Divide and the Illusion of CommunitySocial Divide and the Illusion of CommunityOne of the most insidious effects of social diabetes is its role in deepening social divides. While the internet promised global connection, it has in practice delivered ideological fragmentation, where algorithms amplifyconfirmation biasand outrage rather than curiosity or empathy.confirmation biasThis leads to identity hardening—people become more extreme in their views, less tolerant of ambiguity, and more emotionally reactive. We mistake shared content for shared values, and disagreement becomes identity threat.Instead of bridging gaps, hyperconnectivity widens them.Healing Social MetabolismHealing Social MetabolismLike its metabolic cousin, social diabetes can be managed—not bycuttingall connections, but by changing its form and dose.cuttingSteps toward healing might include:Steps toward healing might include:•Digital portion control: Schedule intentional times for connection—and solitude.Digital portion control•Prioritize depth over breadth: Focus on a few emotionally safe, honest relationships.Prioritize depth over breadth•Be embodied: Seek out real-world experiences of connection—dinners, eye contact, physical proximity.Be embodied•De-curate: Share imperfectly.

Rebuilding Trust and Healing Through Post-Traumatic Growth
--- Data ---
You’re standing on the edge of a platform, eyes closed, heart pounding in your chest. You’re about to fall backward, relying on someone to catch you in a classic trust fall. It’s not just your physical safety you’re handing over to them, but your emotional well-being too. How do you feel? Vulnerable and uncertain, or confident and excited?That moment of suspended uncertainty is the essence of trust in relationships. It’s the act of vulnerability: letting go of control and believing, despite the risks, that someone will be there to catch you before you hit the ground. It’s about having faith that others will be there when you need them most.Where someone falls on the trust spectrum often depends on their experiences. Trust isn’t just shaped by your current partner, whether it’s been reinforced or broken, but also by the past. Early experiences with parents, caregivers, and friends, as well as current and former romantic partners, lay the foundation for how safe or vulnerable we feel when relying on others. Over time, these patterns contribute to our ability to trust. Do we build walls or bridges? Do we brace for impact, or do we trust the landing?Trust is one of those qualities we rely on every day without thinking about it, until it’s gone. For those who have deep trust in their partner, they engage in the trust fall regularly. Over time, it becomes instinctive and automatic, they no longer question whether they’ll be caught. It’s just a given.But what happens when trust disappears? You fall back, expecting the arms of the person you’ve entrusted to catch you, only to feel the hard thud of the ground beneath you, or worse, you nosedive into the jagged rocks below. Betrayal,fear, and shock hit like a tidal wave, leaving you gasping for air and trying to regain your footing.fearThe emotional fallout of broken trust can be severe. While not everyone experiences betrayal as a trauma, research by Laaser and colleagues (2017) found that 60.89 percent of women who experienced relational betrayal met the criteria forPTSDas outlined in theDSM-5. The majority of women in the study (96 percent) reported that the betrayal was “verytraumatic” in their lives, with more than half (56.7 percent) identifying it as the most traumatic event they had ever experienced. These findings highlight the profound emotional impact betrayal has and underscore the complex trauma that can result from broken trust.PTSDDSM-5traumaticYet, healing is possible, even in the aftermath of relational betrayal. According to Laaser and colleagues (2017), many individuals who initially experience intense distress after betrayal later report experiencingpost-traumatic growthin areas such as personal strength, emotionalresilience, andspiritualchange. (It's important to note that while some researchers view post-traumatic growth as genuine personal development, others see it as anillusory defense or a coping mechanismfor trauma.)post-traumatic growthresiliencespiritualillusory defense or a coping mechanismIn Coexistence with PainPost-traumatic growth isn’t about simplymoving onfrom the betrayal, it coexists with the pain. It provides clarity on what works and what doesn’t in a relationship, along with the ability to set healthyboundaries. Such growth, as a direct result of betrayal, helps individuals rebuild from the emotional wreckage.In Coexistence with PainIn Coexistence with Painmoving onboundariesFor example, someone who once feared coming across asjealousor insecure might learn to communicate their needs more effectively. Instead of keeping silent, they might say, “When you spend time alone with this colleague, I feel uncomfortable. Let’s talk about how we can both feel secure in our relationship.” They can learn that expressing their needs doesn’t make them weak, it makes them stronger and more connected to their partner.jealousWhy Do Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas?Only by Trusting Others Can You Get Their True MeasureHealing from betrayal isn’t just about time, it’s about how you use that time. Individualtherapy, especially with a clinician trained in trauma or relational betrayal, can provide a safe space to process emotions and rebuildself-worth. Support groups can help normalize the experience and remind individuals they’re not alone. Psychoeducational resources like books, podcasts, or workshops may provide insights into relational healing. For partners choosing to repair their relationship, couples therapy can help restore trust. While the path to healing looks different for everyone, having the right tools can make a significant difference.therapyself-worthNow, you’re standing on the edge of that platform once again. Your eyes are closed, and your heart pounds in your chest. You’re about to fall backward, for the first time since trust was broken and repaired. The edge feels familiar, but the fall is different now. You've experienced the fragile nature of trust and the long, sometimes painful, but ultimately transformative process of healing. You are different, too. As you lean back, you recognize the strength you’ve developed through post-traumatic growth—the emotional resilience, the courage, and the understanding of your own needs. You still choose to trust again, but this time, it’s a conscious decision rather than a leap of faith.

The Psychology of the Stock Market
--- Data ---
In the daily financial news cycle, one might read that “the market is nervous,” “Wall Street is cheering,” or “the market punished the sector.” These humanized descriptions attribute emotions, reactions, and even motivations to what is, at its core, a complex system of transactions and expectations. But is it accurate or helpful to discuss the market as if it were a person? And with the growing role of algorithmic trading, does the market even have a mind of its own anymore?Journalists, investors, and analysts regularly anthropomorphize the stock market. When the Federal Reserve hints at raising interest rates, headlines often imply that “the market panicked.” If a tech company surpasses earnings expectations, it is said that the market “celebrated.” This linguistic framing creates the impression that the stock market possesses a coherent consciousness that reacts to external stimuli much like a human would.This metaphorical treatment, however, serves as a shorthand for the collective reactions of numerous human and algorithmic actors.Behavioral financeresearch demonstrates that investor psychology frequently plays a significant role in market movements. Cognitive biases such as herd behavior, loss aversion, and overconfidence are well-documented market forces (Massei, 2023).Behavioral financeMassei, 2023For instance, widespreadfearmay lead topanicselling during market downturns, worsening losses. Conversely,optimismcan elevate prices well beyond fundamental valuations during bull runs, creating bubbles. This aligns with research showing that crowd psychology can significantly distort market dynamics (Lange & Borch, 2014).fearpanicoptimismLange & Borch, 2014Despite the psychological framing, many stock trades are not executed by humans at all. Recent estimates indicate that 60-80% of U.S. equity trades are generated through algorithmic or high-frequency trading (HFT) systems (Oyeniyi & Ugochukwu, 2024). These systems utilize large-scale data, predictive models, and lightning-fast execution to identify and capitalize on arbitrage opportunities.Oyeniyi & UgochukwuThese algorithms can respond to earnings reports, news headlines, and macroeconomic indicators in milliseconds—much faster than any human could react. Paradoxically, while these systems aim to strip awayemotion, they may unintentionally amplify it. Some studies suggest that the behavior of algorithms cantriggeremotional responses in human traders, contributing to feedback loops of volatility (Bao et al., 2022).emotiontriggerBao et al., 2022Interestingly, some algorithms are designed to detect market sentiment or public mood and trade accordingly. One study explored systems that employ natural language processing to interpret investor mood and incorporate it into trading logic (Martínez & Román, 2019).Martínez & Román, 2019So, does the market have a “personality”? From a technical standpoint, no. The market lacks consciousness, self-awareness, or intent. However, it does exhibit emergent behaviors that appear personal. These behaviors arise from the aggregation of human cognitive biases, institutionaldecision-making, and algorithmic feedback.personalitydecision-makingScholars have described these emergent patterns as mesoscale psychological dynamics. On this middle ground, neither individual psychology nor macroeconomic indicators alone can explain behavior (Lussange et al., 2019). This lends some credence to the idea that what we perceive as “market mood” may be a real, albeit emergent, phenomenon.Lussange et al., 2019Money Talks: Decoding the Cultural Messages We ReceiveCompanies That Have More Gender Diversity Do BetterFurthermore, the symbolic language of marketanthropomorphismmay fulfill a social or psychological purpose. It simplifies complexity and offers a narrative framework for investors and the public to understand chaos (Borch, 2022).anthropomorphismBorch, 2022Describing the market as if it were a person might not be entirely factually accurate. However, it is not entirely fiction either. It serves as a metaphor that captures the intertwining of psychology, data, and decision-making. In a sense, what we perceive is not a ghost in the machine but a reflection of ourselves—our fears, hopes, and worldviews—projected onto a complex system.Recognize Your BiasesUnderstand the MachinesintuitionThink Long-TermUltimately, the stock market is less a rational machine or emotional entity and more a mirror of our collective psyche—amplified by algorithms. Though it doesn’t “feel,” we describe it as if it does because weneedto make sense of its chaos. By understanding both the psychology behind our decisions and the automation driving the trades, we become wiser participants in the system that we so often humanize.need

Faith-Sensitive Therapy
--- Data ---
For many individuals seeking mental health support, faith isn't merely a cultural practice or affiliation—it represents a foundational framework through which they understand themselves and navigate life's challenges. Despite this reality, mental health professionals have historically maintained a cautious distance from clients' spiritual dimensions, for good reason. However, recent research suggests this separation represents a missed opportunity for more effective, culturally responsive care that honors the whole person.The empirical case for integratingspiritualityinto mental health treatment has grown substantially over the past decade. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate remarkable correlations between religious/spiritual engagement and positive mental health outcomes. Coelho-Júnior et al. (2022) analyzed data from 102 studies involving almost 80,000 individuals and found that highreligiositycorrelated with reducedanxietyanddepressionwhile positively associating with life satisfaction, meaning in life, and psychological well-being.spiritualityreligiosityanxietydepressionThis robust evidence base challenges the historical separation between spiritual care and mental health treatment. As Koenig (2012) found in a comprehensive review of the literature, religiosity/spirituality correlates positively with numerous protective psychological factors, includingoptimism(in 81% of relevant studies), meaning and purpose (93%), and positive character traits likeforgiveness(85%).optimismforgivenessFaith-sensitive, or faith-friendlytherapydoesn't replace evidence-based approaches but accompanies and enhances therapy models by integrating the faith/spirituality dimension of life into the clinical process. Research suggests that when therapists acknowledge and respectfully engage with clients' spiritual frameworks, therapeutic alliance strengthens, and treatment outcomes improve (Pearce et al., 2015).therapyEffective faith-sensitive integration begins with professional self-awareness. Therapists must examine their own biases and assumptions about religion while developing religious literacy—understanding diverse faith traditions' perspectives on suffering, healing, and well-being. Without this foundation, clinicians risk imposing their own worldviews or misinterpreting clients' spiritual experiences through pathologizing frameworks.Assessment should routinely include spiritual history, exploring how clients' faith informs their understanding of their challenges and what spiritual resources they might draw upon. The HOPE assessment framework (Anandarajah & Hight, 2001) offers one structured approach, examining sources of Hope, the importance of Organized religion, Personal spirituality practices, and Effects on medical care and end-of-life decisions.As Papaleontiou-Louca (2021) notes, distinguishing between healthy and potentially harmful religious coping is essential during assessment. Pargament et al. (1998) identified positive religious coping patterns (seeking spiritual support, benevolent religious reappraisals) that correlate with better outcomes versus negative patterns (spiritual discontent, punishing God reappraisals) that predict poorer adjustment.Treatment adaptations respect faith frameworks while maintaining therapeutic integrity. For example, cognitive-behavioral approaches can be enhanced by incorporating relevant spiritual texts or teachings that reinforce adaptive thinking patterns. Pearce and Koenig (2013) developed ChristianCognitive BehavioralTherapy, which integrates scripture and prayer with traditional CBT techniques, demonstrating significant efficacy for religious clients with depression.Cognitive BehavioralSimilarly,mindfulnesspractices might be framed withinmeditationtraditions familiar to the client. For Christians, centering prayer offers parallels to secular mindfulness; for Muslims, muraqaba provides comparable contemplative practice. These adaptations maintain therapeutic mechanisms while enhancing cultural resonance and acceptability.mindfulnessmeditationThe Psychological Benefits of Spirituality3 Positive Practices to Increase Your Well-BeingImplementing faith-sensitive therapy requires thoughtful navigation of several challenges. First is maintaining appropriateboundariesbetween therapy and spiritual direction. The therapist's role remains focused on psychological well-being rather than theological guidance or spiritual formation, though these domains inevitably overlap.boundariesSecond is developing comfort with religious language and concepts without overstepping professional competence.Vieten et al. (2013) developed spiritual and religious competencies for psychologiststhat provide guidance, emphasizing knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed for effective cross-cultural practice in this domain.Vieten et al. (2013) developed spiritual and religious competencies for psychologistsThird is addressing potential conflicts between religious teachings and psychological principles. When these tensions arise, collaborative exploration works better than confrontation. By asking curious questions about how clients integrate seemingly contradictory perspectives, therapists help clients develop more nuanced understanding without imposing secularized values.Faith isn't always protective. Religious struggles—questioning one's beliefs, feeling abandoned by God, or experiencing conflict with religious communities—can intensify psychological distress. Exline et al. (2000) found that religious strain correlated significantly with depression andsuicidalityamong college students.suicidalityWortmann and Park (2009) observed that while many find meaning through faith duringbereavement, others experience significant spiritual struggles that can complicate grief. These "dark nights of the soul" require specialized therapeutic understanding that neither dismisses spiritual dimensions nor pathologizes normative religious questioning.bereavementFaith-sensitive therapists recognize when religious struggles representsecondary traumarequiring specialized intervention versus normative spiritual development. They create safe spaces for clients to explore doubts without judgment while distinguishing between spiritual growth and mental health deterioration.secondary traumaEffective faith-sensitive therapy often involvescollaborationwith spiritual leaders. Clergy frequently serve as mental health first responders, with studies showing that approximately 40% of individuals seek religious counsel before professional mental health support (Schafer, 2010).collaborationHealthcare systems increasingly recognize the value of chaplaincy services within interdisciplinary care teams. During theCOVID-19pandemic, Goodwin and Kraft (2022) documented how faith communities provided critical psychosocial support when traditional services were disrupted, offering presence and communication when people felt isolated, continuity of support over time, and frameworks for making meaning of unprecedented circumstances.COVID-19The most promising collaborative models view spiritual leaders and mental health professionals as complementary resources rather than competing authorities. Each brings distinct expertise and perspectives that, together, can address the complexities of human suffering more comprehensively than either could alone.For clinicians interested in developing faith-sensitive competencies, initial steps include:educationWhen therapists approach spirituality with the same respect they give to other cultural dimensions, they open possibilities for more effective, person-centered care—care that honors the whole person, including their deepest beliefs about ultimate meaning and purpose.Faith-sensitive therapy represents a significant frontier in the ongoing effort to provide culturally responsive mental health care. Far from compromising evidence-based practice, thoughtful integration of spiritual dimensions enhances therapeutic effectiveness for the substantial portion of clients who identify faith as central to their lives. As our understanding of mental health continues to evolve toward more holistic models, the artificial separation between psychological and spiritual well-being increasingly appears both outdated and unnecessarily limiting.

Can You Outsource Motivation?
--- Data ---
As physicians, we know that many of the most common diseases could be prevented—or even reversed—through sustained behavior change. Behavior change is far more complex than medical adherence—it requiresmotivation, consistency, and long-term effort.motivationHow do we help patients make the changes they need to heal? One answer is to leverage healthcoachingin your clinical practice. This solution has improved outcomes and enhanced success rates for some of my most difficult-to-treat patients.coachingIn medical training, we’re taught to diagnose and treat. But with certain chronic diseases, treatment isn’t just about prescribing the rightmedication—it’s about helping patients make important behavioral and lifestyle changes.medicationMaking health-positive changes is hard and most people struggle with this. Nearly all patients want to get healthy, but the struggle lies in overcoming the psychological, social, and environmental barriers to change.But for some patients, behavioral change isn’t just about improving overall health—it’s essential for driving corrective neuroplasticity. In these cases, maladaptiveneuralnetworks lie at the heart of the condition’s pathophysiology, making behavior change the cornerstone of effective treatment.neuralMany of the patients I treat are affected by central sensitization (CS) syndromes. While the CS model was originally developed to explain chronic pain, its underlying pathophysiology extends to many of the chronic conditions I see regularly, including hyperacusis, severe tinnitus, and chronic vertigo.In the classic CS model, the process begins with an acute inflammatory event that lowers sensory thresholds (peripheral sensitization). If this persists, it can lead to central neuroplastic changes, rewiring the brain in a way that maintains chronic sensory hypersensitivity long after the triggering event has resolved (central sensitization).Common examples of CS syndromes include:Chronic Pain SyndromesFibromyalgiaFibromyalgiaChronic fatigue syndromeProlonged post-concussionsymptomsconcussionLongCOVIDCOVIDMost types of tinnitus and vertigoClassic and atypicalmigrainemigraineIrritable bowel syndromeInterstitial cystitisCentral sensitization syndromes can be classified as “sensory processingdisorders,” and they often have overlapping symptoms, including:sensory processingChronic painFatigueSleep disturbancesCognitive dysfunctionBrain fogmemoryMood disturbancesAnxietydepressionSensory sensitivitySuccessful treatment of CS syndromes requires behavioral change.The core pathology involves increased sensory sensitivity driven by neuroplastic changes at the time of symptom onset. Reversing these maladaptive neural networks—rewiring the brain—requires consistent behavioral modifications.The cells that were wired together must now be wired apart.Successful treatment of CS syndromes requires behavioral change.The cells that were wired together must now be wired apart.Pharmaceuticals may help stabilize excitation-inhibition imbalances, but they don’t reverse the underlying neuroplastic changes.

It allows medical professionals to focus on diagnosing and treating, while coaches ensure that patients follow through on the plan of action.The result: Improved patient outcomes, higher adherence rates, and ultimately, a more effective healthcare service.Healthcare is evolving. We are moving beyond the old model of “diagnose and prescribe” toward a more holistic approach that acknowledges the critical role of behavior change in healing.

It’s a game-changer—not just for your patients, but for your practice as well.

Bridging Belief and Identity
--- Data ---
Research indicates that the pathways between religious beliefs and LGBTQ+ attitudes are mediated by sociopersonality factors such as religious conservatism, authoritarianism, and fundamentalism (Etengoff & Lefevor, 2021). These trends seem to be reflected in political views as well, with the Public Research on Religion Institute (PRRI, 2022) reporting that only 3% of conservatives in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ, compared with 9% of moderates and 19% of liberals. Relatedly, those who identify with Christian nationalist views are about five times as likely as others to support allowing religiously-based service refusals (61% and 12%, respectively;PRRI, 2022). Larger sociopolitical shifts outlined by Bronfenbrenner’s chronosystem (1979), such as the recent rise of conservatism in the United States, may also acutely contribute to clients’stressrelated to internalized sexism,sexualprejudice, familial exclusion, and political insecurity.PRRIPRRIstresssexualprejudiceTo provide effective psychological support during this tense sociopolitical landscape, clinicians can adopt approaches that acknowledge the complexities of long held communal beliefs while promoting personal growth and well-being. To meet this aim, clinicians may find it to be helpful to incorporate the following clinical strategies into their therapeutic work and relationship building exercises:Culturally Competent Counseling:Encouraging Self-Exploration:Promoting Cognitive Flexibility:Creating a Safe Space:Intergroup Contact and Exposure:Clinicians play a vital role in guiding clients through the complexities of sociopolitically situatedgenderand sexual prejudice.

Out of the Mouths of Babes Come Profound Insights
--- Data ---
Children may be innocent, blithely unaware of the challenges and complexities typifying much adult communication. But lacking all “learned” sophistication, that very innocence can betray insights that adults consciously struggle to come up with.In human affairs,wisdomis typically regarded as developing only through the accumulation and correct interpretation of human interactions. It’s an outgrowth of sufficient relational experience.wisdomNot uncommonly, adults disguise the truth of their observations as a matter of tact or diplomacy. On the contrary, children, not yet aware of other people’s feelings and how easy it is to hurt them, will blurt out, unedited, truths that are free of any malice, vindictiveness, or deceit, but also free of any prudent judgment or forethought.Intuitively grasping that cordial relationships are more important than the disagreements that, however temporarily, undermine them, children will say things like, “Why can’t you just be friends?” To them, relational discord is unnatural and ought to be easily remedied merely by “letting bygones be bygones.”Adult sophistication—or maybe righteous indignation—gets in the way of reverting to this more natural state of compatibility. Sticking to one’s guns may superficially feel empowering, but it can’t move conflict into a more agreeable, companionable state.On another note, because children don’t comprehend that as responsible adults, play isearnedthrough work, they’ll innocently inquire as to why we can’t just play all the time. And as easy as it is to dismiss such naive thinking, it can also get us to think about whether our work/play balance is out of whack, as we regularly, and unthinkingly, value work overplay.earnedThe golden mean here often involves finding the middle ground between work and play. Children may lean too heavily in the direction of play but adults may be just as guilty in implicitly prioritizing work over play.Sure, we may need need to engage in a certain amount of work just to survive, but when that amount downgrades, or virtually obliterates play, our exaggerated sense of what our survival depends on may renderhappinessunobtainable. And even if we’re not conscious of it, isn’t our goal in life not simply to survive but to achieve an unassailable state of well-being?happinessHowever embryonic, children also demonstrate a hard-wired sense of empathy. How else would they interpret the frequently observed circumstance of a child’s offering another child who’s crying a toy to alleviate their distress?As regards judgment, young children haven’t yet absorbed the rules of their culture. So, without questioning the relative legitimacy of different behaviors, they’re apt to accept any behavior not directly threatening their welfare.Lastly, children can experience joy in such simple things as being able to go outside and play or “techni-coloring” (say, an animal in a coloring book). Theirimaginationis far less circumscribed by conventions that society sooner or later will impose on them.imagination©2025Leon F. Seltzer, Ph.D.All Rights Reserved.©Leon F. Seltzer, Ph.D.

It's Hard to Love Yourself When You Hate Your Name
--- Data ---
Imagine hating your own name.Imagine gagging every time you hear, see, say, or write it.I hated my name from the moment I realized it was mine.It sounded like a snarl: Sharon Joy.It twisted faces — first into a cruel smile: shaaarrr, then slackjawed stupor, unnnnj, then oyyy, a feeble wail.I knew no other kids who loathed their names.My classmates cherished their names, chanting them as anthems, scrawling them as charms. Whenever someone said, “Hi, my name’s Kay” — or Julio, or Lynn — then asked, “What's yours?" I nodded mutely as if baffled by this protocol.Having a name you didn’t hate seemed to me a wildly underappreciated blessing, like having a neck.By contrast, hating your name feels like wearing ice skates and an ape mask everywhere, even to bed.But I was lucky: only child, toys, clothes, vacations such as one to Amsterdam when I was 10, and during which my dad admired a row of boats.“This one,” he said, pointing, “has more stuff on it than those.”Caught up in the sunny spirit, I echoed two words he’d said—but in the British accent of my favorite singer, Davy Jones. Moah stahf. Mistaking this for mockery, which it was not, Dad thwacked me in the head.So quick: One suntanned hand.He'd never previously done this. Dad was not a savage brute who clomped around pummeling everyone. He was a smart aerospace engineer who wore a wristwatch. He had never injured anyone, not even in the war.I reckoned, arithmetically, that Sharon Joy and only Sharon Joy had forced her friendly father into violence in a waffle-scented wonderland. I thought: Kids named Chris or Alicia never would.The fact that Mom said "You've annoyed him" in the censorious tone you'd use to scold someone for spilling sauce was further proof.And yes, I know that, compared with what others suffer, it was nothing.Self-loathingsometimes feels too right to feel wrong. Sometimes everything you do, say, eat, or wear seems like another Amsterdam.Self-loathingAnd yes, normal adults don't hate their names. They simply live as Garth or Madisyn or Fritz, while tackling bigger issues such as bankruptcy or wolves.And yes: If I had $5 for every time someone has said, "But Sharon's such a pretty name," I'd buy Kauai.That name glared up at me like courtroom evidence from schoolwork, diplomas, then articles I wrote as a young journalist. I could have used a pseudonym, but that seemed like a lie, and Mom said liars were like thieves.One day, I met a nurse who'd changed her name from Deborah to Dragon. She said such changes, in California, required merely getting new ID cards.It's like she'd said I could fly.You can choose anything.But choosing anything, even socks, always froze me. Researchers call this conditionoverchoice—mental paralysis when faced with more than, say, six options.overchoiceI listed my favorite names, then erased them so harshly that the paper tore. Surely I did not deserve to be called Belle, Cookie, Candy, or Inez.I warned myself: Choose something less execrable than Sharon Joy but nothing so extravagantly lovely as to make your having it a mockery, like hanging diamonds on a pig. No Lily or Evangeline for you. Pick something passable but plain.Get It—Write! What a Writing Class Taught Me About LifeThe Challenge of Staying in Long-Term TreatmentExpectant parents, trans people, and whoever seeks new names know: This quest is epic. Namers are gods. This as-yet-unlabeled creature might fly jets, rule Spain, or live inside a hollow log, stroking snails: By what set of sounds shall they know themself and be known?But see: How do you name someone you hate?Imagine thinking you can't simply have a nice name any more than you can simply have a whale. Imagine feeling that your new name must be better than your old one, just okay enough to nonchalantly say, but—like trousers fished from a refuse bin—not great.How do you name someone you hate when you know naming them won’t change them? How, when Sharon Joy could become Tessa Jane or Reece Alexis or Sakura Microchip, yet still has ugly hair and picks up filthy pennies off the street? What’s a new name if not a cheap disguise?Self-hatred seldom introduces itself as self-hatred. Self-haters know no solidarity, no welcome wagon, no sense that we're not alone.My quest became a public joke. Coworkers cut names out of newspapers—Jermajesty Jackson, Ima Hogg—and taped them to my desk.Studies showthat names underscore our very sense of history,identity, and self.Studies showidentityOne day, I shut my eyes and swore to pick whichever name my finger touched first in the phone book. But it was Jean, the name of my college roommate who hadsexin the top bunk while I lay in the bottom and whom I disliked as much as I disliked myself.sexFor seven months I felt as if I had no name, that Sharon Joy was cauterized yet unreplaced. The nameless, rendered so by force or choice, remain uncoded, lost, adrift, invisible, unblessed.Then one day I saw, gleaming through pale sunlight on a library-book page, and liked a name that was exactly everything I didn’t want.In a Swedish novel last checked out 18 years before, it shimmered like a secret cryptograph meant just for me: This name was Anneli.I liked it with that raggedgratitudein which, after emerging from wild woods where you've been lost for weeks, you like the one-night stand whom you, the next day, marry in a bar.gratitudeBeginning and ending with vowels, phonetically amorphous—accented on its first syllable, but who could tell? And common in its homeland but unknown thus bombastic in mine, Anneli soon festooned my new passport and everything I wrote.But by then, I despised it.[This was Part One of a two-part essay.

Clarifying Common Myths About Behaviorism in Education
--- Data ---
My recent article, "Behavior ModificationIs Everywhere: WhyEducationCan’t Afford to Pretend Otherwise," sparked thoughtful, even passionate, comments from readers. These responses highlighted common concerns, misunderstandings, and valuable questions aboutbehaviorismand education. Here, I address several recurring themes, clarifying how behaviorists respond and why behaviorism remains relevant and valuable across all fields of education.Behavior ModificationEducationbehaviorismSeveral commenters raised fundamental questions: What exactly is the educational problem behaviorism seeks to solve? Is the issue poor student engagement, superficial learning masked by grades, or the unclear purpose of education itself?From abehavioristperspective, the fundamental problem education must address is observable skill attainment. Behaviorists argue that genuine learning manifests as behaviors students can consistently demonstrate. It’s not enough to achieve high grades or pass tests, students must reliably exhibit specific competencies. Thus, the core educational challenge is clearly defining, teaching, and reinforcing observable behaviors representative of true mastery.behavioristWhile standardized tests frequently fail to capture genuine skill demonstration, behaviorists recognize the issue lies not with the concept of assessment itself but with poorly designed assessments. Effective assessments must clearly measure observable skills, enabling students to consistently demonstrate their mastery.A common critique is thefearthat behaviorism mechanizes learning, reducing students to robots responding automatically to rewards and punishments. This critique, while understandable, is rooted in a misunderstanding.fearBehaviorism emphasizes clarity and consistency in defining student learning outcomes not because it disregards humanity, but precisely because it respects it. Clear, observablegoalsprotect students from arbitrary judgments and subjective evaluations. Properly structured behavioral reinforcement supports autonomy, independence, and genuine skill acquisition. Behaviorism isn’t about control or coercion; it is about clarity, transparency, and fairness.goalsRather than stripping away individuality or autonomy, a well-designed behavioral approach reinforces behaviors that allow learners to experience genuine success and independence. The key is designing stimuli and reinforcement thoughtfully, supporting students in mastering skills they genuinely value and can independently apply.Some readers argue that behaviorism is incompatible with concepts like autonomy orfree will. Indeed, radical behaviorists traditionally view internal states such as beliefs, values, or free will as scientifically unobservable. However, behaviorists do not deny that individuals engage in behaviors we commonly label as "autonomous."free willWhat behaviorism does reject is the explanation of behavior through invisible internal processes. Instead, behaviorists view autonomy as a series of observable behaviors, shaped through reinforcement histories that encourage independence, critical thinking,creativity, andself-regulation. Thus, autonomy from a behaviorist perspective isn't an illusion, instead it is an observable pattern of learned behaviors supported by consistent reinforcement.creativityself-regulationWhy Education Is ImportantTake our ADHD TestFind a Child TherapistCritics also questioned whether behaviorism adequately explains skill transfer across contexts. Some suggest behaviorism implies that students trained in one context cannot easily transfer skills to another context with different stimuli.Behaviorists fully recognize the challenge of skill transfer and generalization. Rather than ignoring it, they emphasize explicitly teaching generalization. Students learn to transfer behaviors across contexts when they experience reinforcement across multiple environments, practicing a skill in varied situations. Thus, generalization itself becomes an essential behavior to reinforce intentionally.Another insightful comment pointed out is how vocational education naturally aligns with behaviorism, whereas traditional academic disciplines might not. Vocational education clearly emphasizes observable, hands-on behaviors, directly assessing skill mastery. But does behaviorism apply equally well to disciplines likephilosophy, poetry, psychology, or law?philosophyWhen School Feels Like HomePreschool Isn't Prep—It's Prime Time for Brain GrowthAbsolutely. Behaviorism is universally applicable precisely because every discipline fundamentally requires skill demonstration. Philosophers demonstrate skills in argumentation and critical analysis; poets exhibit observable competencies in language use and emotional expression; psychologists visibly apply therapeutic techniques and analytical skills; lawyers demonstrate persuasive advocacy and logical reasoning. Thus, behaviorism is not confined to technical trades but inherently relevant across all educational fields.A common misconception suggests that behaviorism views skills as commodities, standardized products identical for every learner, akin to purchasing identical smartphones. This, however, misrepresents behaviorism. While behaviorists value clarity and consistency in defining expected behaviors, they fully recognize individual differences arising from unique reinforcement histories.Each learner inevitably develops a distinctive behavioral repertoire shaped by personalized experiences and interactions. Behaviorism does not seek identical outcomes for all learners; rather, it seeks clearly defined, observable, and reinforced skills that each learner demonstrates according to their unique contexts and experiences. Individual differences in skill attainment are not failures but precisely what behavioral principles predict and embrace.Far from mechanizing or dehumanizing education, behaviorism promotes transparency, fairness, and effective skill development across all fields. The goal is not rigid compliance or superficial performance, but genuine, observable mastery. Behaviorism invites educators to thoughtfully design environments and reinforcement structures that encourage meaningful, lasting, and generalizable learning outcomes.By clarifying these misconceptions and addressing these thoughtful critiques, we move closer to an education system that better respects and supports the complex, observable behaviors that truly represent human learning.In embracing behaviorism’s clarity, consistency, and fairness, educators can provide all students with richer, more meaningful, and genuinely empowering learning experiences.

Get It—Write! What a Writing Class Taught Me About Life

That great philosopher Satchel Paige said, "Don't look back; something might be gaining on you." Usually, that's myphilosophytoo. Sometimes, however, it's good to look back to see how you got where you are today. It's not always clear in the moment. Mostly time is an illusion, but occasionally time is a gift. Sometimes we need the gift of time.philosophyMany years ago, when I was looking for something to do while my kids were in school—besides writing, housework, and grocery shopping—I took a writing class at a local college. I'd been a writer for 25 years by then (I started at a very young age). But I thought: What the heck. Why not? I'm not interested in anything else. The course was called "Reader/Writer" and met once a week from September to December. The course was for grown-ups but not for credit, which meant we could relax, more or less, about making the grade.There were eight of us—five women and three men, including the teacher. We were a taut, intense group with a wide variety of life experiences. We liked each other immediately.Our secondary goal was to read and discuss as much great literature as possible: Austen's "Emma," Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina," Dickens's "David Copperfield." It was a highly idiosyncratic curriculum, put together by our enthusiastic teacher, whose basic theory was that if you want to learn about really good fiction writing, the 19th century is the place to be.Our primary goal was to write, early and often, and as well as we could. Most of us were working on "something." Along the way, we got optional assignments to nudge, needle, and encourage us. It was a grueling task, the writing and rewriting all week long, followed by the reading aloud of our precious prose (one hopes not too precious) to our peers. We loved it more than anything else we were otherwise occupied with. We put writing sort of on a par with breathing.I'd never taken a writing class before. Okay, I lie. I mean, I took the ones you couldn't get out of in grade school, high school, and college. I'd spent one summer eons ago at a writer's conference, which only convinced me that novelists were a breed apart.Having been raised by a writer whose unspoken motto was "just do it," I had shunned academics in favor of deadlines. Halfway through college, a very nice newspaper took me under its wing, gave me a job, and made a writer out of me.Well, sort of.Two decades later, having survived a six-year, self-imposed sabbatical from writing (during which I did a lot of diaper changing and related activities), I was far more aware of what I didn't know than what I did know.When I was younger and hadn't done very much with my life, I was sure I could do anything. After accomplishing a few minor miracles and majorgoals, I wasn't sure how I did any of it. Mirrors, I suspect, had something to do with it. Lots of fast talk, too. None of which is ultimately very satisfying. Because eventually we need to acknowledge and feed the need to learn something. And to do more than "just do it," but to do it well. The Beach Boys sang, "Catch a wave, you'll be sitting on top of the world." What the song doesn't say, first you have to learn how to surf.goalsWanting and hoping to become a better writer was the wave that carried me into that small classroom in the fall of 1997. I suspect it was the same wave that brought my other classmates to that shore. And for two hours a week, life was a beach and the eight of us soaked up rays of inspiration and perspiration, and sheer endurance that make up the craft of writing.We were brutally honest with each other about what didn't work in our writing. We were wonderfully effusive about what did work.We were, most of all, kind to each other. No one had an ax to grind, a knife to plunge. We were unarmed, not dangerous. It was a safe place to come. Outside was the world of rejection letters, not enough time, and rent to pay. Inside, it was just us guys and the literary masters, and a teacher whose love of reading and writing was so palpable it made believers of us all. It made me believe I could tell the truth while making up a story; that fiction was, in essence, fact.Now that I'm no longer one of the newly converted. To all of you who love word-work and wordplay, get thee to a writing class. Take that pottery course next year. Find a group that's united by a common bond, the love of the task. Accept no substitutes. Just do it, and I suspect you'll find you do it pretty well.It's Hard to Love Yourself When You Hate Your NameThe Challenge of Staying in Long-Term TreatmentYou'll find that you've run out of excuses, that the dog didn't eat your homework, and that someone's got to fill that empty page, and it might as well be you. You'll wipe out more than a few times, but sooner or later, you'll catch a wave and be sitting on top of the world.I intended to take that class as a one-and-done.I ended up taking it again and again, like several others did.Occasionally, we make choices that we never regret. Here are my fab four best decisions: marrying my husband, having children, becoming a writer, and taking the writing class offered by the continuingeducationdepartment at Sarah Lawrence College.education

Positively Energizing Leadership Fuels Work Performance

How can leaders have the greatest impact on others’ performance?Surprisingly, it’s not about leading with information and influence.It’s also not about showing up in an overlyoutgoingorcharismaticway, which can sometimes feel inauthentic.outgoingcharismaticThe secret toleadershipimpact is positive relational energy.leadershipRelational energy is the energy that occurs in interactions between individuals. In business, it is the positive energy a leader creates when interacting with others that renews, uplifts, and energizes them. It results in the recipient feeling vital with increased energy to take action, leading to improved well-being and performance.Unfortunately, leadership skill development typically doesn’t focus on how leaders cancultivate and sharetheir positive energy. However, there is enormous potential for leaders to increase their leadership impact through building an awareness of positive relational energy.cultivate and shareKim Cameron, one of the founders of positive leadership,proposed that the mostsuccessful leaders energize others.

What Are Intrusive Thoughts, and Why Do They Cause Trouble?
--- Data ---
The term “intrusive thoughts” has become common parlance from mental health creators onsocial mediasuch as TikTok, and people have resonated with it. In psychiatry, we don’t usually talk about intrusive thoughts as one entity, but rather, we look at specific types of intrusive thinking that come up in variouspsychiatricconditions. While the broader term that has taken hold is accurate and helps people communicate their experience, it’s also incomplete because not all intrusive thoughts are alike, and we need more detail to build successful interventions.social mediapsychiatricIn a 2005 book about intrusive thoughts in psychiatric disorders by David Clark, they are described as“any distinct, identifiable cognitive eventthat is unwanted, unintended, and recurrent.It interrupts the flow of thought, interferes in task performance, is associated with negative affect, and is difficult to control.”(1) In plain language, it means these are thoughts you don’t want, and you can’t control, and they keep coming back. They make it hard to think about other things and do the tasks you need to do, and they cause emotional distress. There can be expected, self-limited versions of intrusive thoughts, and there can be harmful, distressing, and unending ones as well.“any distinct, identifiable cognitive eventthat is unwanted, unintended, and recurrent.that is unwanted, unintended, and recurrent.It interrupts the flow of thought, interferes in task performance, is associated with negative affect, and is difficult to control.”Normal episodes of intrusive thinking can be triggered by life events, such asgriefand loss. When my mom died 20 years ago, I couldn’t stop thinking about her, and I couldn’t quiet the thoughts for weeks. As the months passed, the intrusive quality of the thoughts settled, and they eventually became more about memories and stories. Exciting events can also lead to a self-limited period of intrusive thoughts. When I found out I waspregnantwith my first child, I asked my friend who had a 2-year-old if I would ever stop thinking every minute about being pregnant. She reassured me it would quiet down, and it did.griefpregnantBut what about intrusive thoughts that don’t resolve on their own? Intrusive thoughts aren’t a diagnosis. A variety of psychiatric disorders can cause intrusive thoughts, and the content and patterns of the thoughts will reflect the underlying diagnosis. Common (but not exclusively) causes of intrusive thoughts includedepression,anxietydisorders,obsessive-compulsivedisorder, andADHD. And while there are approaches that can help intrusive thoughts in a general way, the most effective interventions address the underlying diagnosis.depressionanxietyobsessive-compulsiveADHDIndepression, people experience intrusive thoughts that are “mood congruent.” That means the thoughts are consistent with the mood tone—dark, negative, hopeless, self-critical, and guilty. “I’m a loser,” or “I only cause people pain,” or “Nothing is good in my life or the world; everything sucks all the time” are typical of intrusive, depressive thoughts. These can spiral into dangerous types of thinking, such as not wanting to live. Depressive intrusive thoughts are often referred to as ruminations.depressiondepressionAnxiety disordersnotoriously cause intrusive thoughts. These include specific phobias—such as repeated thoughts about bridges collapsing and how to get places without going over a bridge. Or it can be more generalized anxiety, thinking “what if” around every possible scary outcome. Everyone has general worries sometimes, such as, “What if someone breaks into my house?” But an anxiety disorder can keep those worries coming over and over, never able to be reassured, making it hard to leave the house—or fall asleep.Anxiety disordersAnxiety disordersIn children, generalized anxious thoughts often include fears of someone breaking into their home or worries about their parents’ safety. Separation anxiety disorder causes children’s thoughts to become crowded with fears of what can happen when a parent is out of sight. In all ages, health worries or social worries are common themes of anxious, intrusive thoughts.What Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?Take our Generalized Anxiety Disorder TestFind a therapist to treat OCDObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)is fundamentally a problem of intrusive thinking. Obsessional fears—worries that can’t be quieted with any logic and return ferociously over and over—are serious medical symptoms.Fearof contamination, fear of saying or doing something you would never actually say or do, and fear that you have already done or said something terrible are some examples. I once worked with a patient who had to re-drive their route home hundreds of times because they thought they had hit something, and they couldn’t be reassured even after checking. OCD thoughts are typically disconnected from our actual interests, actions, values, and desires—and disconnected from any reassurances or logical explanations, important features in distinguishing OCD thoughts from other types of intrusive thinking.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCDFearAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)is a common cause of intrusive thinking—a “busy brain” that’s always thinking and hard to quiet. People struggle to cut through their thoughts to focus on the task at hand. Or there may be over-focus on one thing, making it hard to move to something else. Intrusive thoughts distract internally, and for many with ADHD, these are as hard external distractions.Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)Is It Disordered Eating or OCD?OCD and the Paradox of DoubtOther diagnoses have intrusive thinking.PTSDflashbacks are highly intrusive experiences that aren’t just thoughts but rather terrifying re-experiences of thetraumaticevents.Autism spectrum disorderis associated with repetitive behavior and thoughts (perseverations) that can be considered intrusive, but they don’t always cause distress for the person experiencing them—they often feel pleasant and comforting.Eating disorderslead to intrusive thoughts about weight,body image, and food. Additional types of intrusive thoughts go beyond this post, such as those inmaniaand schizophrenia. But importantly, intrusive thoughts are important symptoms in many psychiatric conditions.PTSDPTSDtraumaticAutism spectrum disorderAutism spectrum disorderEating disordersEating disordersbody imagemaniaCombinations of intrusive thinking variations are common, which can complicate the story, but addressing origins remains critical in developing the most effective interventions—types oftherapy, medications, work and school supports, groups and community resources,coaching, family interventions, and more.therapycoachingIntrusive thoughts are like uninvited guests who show up without warning and start shouting at you—and they won’t leave, and they won’t shut up. What they are saying and how they say it will vary based on their origins—but until you figure out where they came from, it will be hard to get them to quiet down and move out.

The Easiest Way to Stop Anxious Overthinking
--- Data ---
If you’ve ever found yourself trapped in a relentless cycle of anxious thoughts—playing out worst-case scenarios, second-guessing yourself, or mentally rehearsing every possible outcome—you know how exhausting overthinking can be. But what if the best way to stop anxious overthinking isn’t about changing your thoughts at all?Surprisingly, one of the most underutilized yet highly effective ways to stop overthinking is to focus on your body instead of your mind. Instead of wrestling with your anxious thoughts, shifting yourattentionto physical movement, breath, and sensations can break the loop in ways pure logic never will.attentionWhen we overthink, we get stuck in the brain’sdefault mode network, which is responsible for self-referential thinking—basically, endless loops about the past and future. The problem? Overanalyzing doesn’t solve problems; it just keepsanxietyalive. Engaging the body disrupts this cycle by activating the brain's present-moment-focused networks, bringing immediate relief.default mode networkanxietyEthan and the Midnight SpiralEthan and the Midnight SpiralEthan, a 35-year-old graphic designer, often found himselflyingawake at night, mentally replaying a conversation with his boss. Did he sound incompetent? Should he have worded something differently? The more he thought about it, the worse he felt.lyingOne night, instead of continuing the spiral, he got out of bed and started stretching. He focused on the feeling of his muscles, the tension in his shoulders, and his breath. Within minutes, his anxiety softened. His brain, now engaged with bodily sensations, could no longer obsess over his perceived mistakes.Lena’s Workout EscapeLena’s Workout EscapeLena, a college student, struggled withsocial anxiety. After hanging out with friends, she would replay conversations, worrying if she had been awkward or said something wrong. One day, after a particularly tough episode of overthinking, she went for a run.

The Death of Science Means a Less Healthy Future
--- Data ---
Today’s attacks on science come from at least three sources, and it is doing immediate, intermediate, and long-term damage to our country, including my profession ofalcoholand drug use medicine.alcoholThree origins of these attacks include the sheer ignorance that comes from a lack ofeducation. For example, political leaders criticizing studies of “transgendermice” propagate misinformation, since these studies are actually of transgenic mice—those in which genetic material from other species has been inserted into theirDNA, like the GMO foods that suffuse ourdiet. Attacks also stem from the typical short-sightedness of business-oriented leaders who value quarterly profits over investing in research and development needed to maintain market position over the next decade. And finally, ideologies that value transactional power tactics and loyalty tend to denigrate academic and bureaucratic experts as elites, who are viewed as obstacles to their “end justifies the means”philosophy.educationtransgenderDNAdietphilosophyWhatever the constellation of sources for the attacks on science, their pragmatic consequences are real and happening now.There are immediate, intermediate, and long-term impacts of these consequences. First, the destruction of our data collection mechanisms is leaving us blind to mental health and alcohol and drug use in America. The slashing of research funding and research agency employees puts critical surveys such as Monitoring the Future and the national household survey of drug use in jeopardy. The Monitoring the Future survey is conducted annually by the University of Michigan to follow trends in alcohol and drug use in eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders across the country. The annual NHDUH survey follows similar trends among families nationwide and is conducted by theSubstance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administration, a division of our National Institute of Health. All these agencies are being dramatically hollowed out, and not with a metaphoric surgical scalpel but rather with clumsy axes and chainsaws.Substance AbuseWe Are Flying BlindThe immediate impact is that public health professionals, clinicians, families, and concerned political leaders are having to fly blind. Without knowing whether opiate use is rising or falling among youth, without knowing how many people are using fentanyl, and without knowing whetheranxietyanddepressionare rising or falling, we have no clear idea of their effects on drug use and mental health. Without hard data, we are more vulnerable to exaggerations and lies about drug crises and our country’s mental health. Leaders can make up whatever narratives advance their ideologicalgoals. We could be told legal cannabis is exploding in use by youth, or that it has no impact on health, and we would have no hard data to guide us in getting on board or refuting these claims. Data is power, and the lack of data cedes power to those who control the government.We Are Flying BlindWe Are Flying BlindanxietydepressiongoalsSecond, intermediate impacts stem from the interruption and stalling of ongoing research. I am especially worried about the adolescent brain and cognitive development longitudinal study of over 12,000 adolescents. This unique study promises a treasure trove of valuable information about brain development, including the impact of prenatal and early exposure to cannabis and other drugs. But longitudinal studies take time. In the case of adolescent brain research, the study has taken over two decades. Interrupting funding will limit the value of data already collected and destroy the opportunity to extend this data to its logical conclusion. Researchers dedicated to this research have developed the expertise to conduct the study and interpret its results, but when funding is cut, this will filter away to other jobs. We will be robbed of important future data, and brain science will be slowed. Axes and chainsaws may be metaphoric, but their damage is real and could take a generation to repair.Third, long-term damage is being done whenever young scientists around the world decide to enter graduate school elsewhere rather than run the risk of coming to the U.S. under student visas. As university research facilities contract and fall under the influence of leaders who do not understand the difference between transgenic and transgender, the brain drain will be reversed. The best minds will choose not to join U.S. research teams, and some of our own best minds are likely to find more lucrative and less restrictive research opportunities elsewhere. Such damage to our legitimately vaunted research tradition could take a lifetime to repair.Academic freedom and research prowess are more vulnerable than we previously assumed. Thecooperationbetween government and academia, which has advanced the frontiers of scientific research, is now proving to be a critical source of this vulnerability. Once deceased, our scientific establishment will not be easily exhumed.cooperationWhat Is Addiction?Find a therapist to overcome addiction

Is My Other-Oriented Perfectionism the Problem?
--- Data ---
“Is my perfectionism the problem?” is a question that’s seldom asked byperfectionists. Much of the popular material on perfectionism is geared toward deepening one’s understanding of how to address self-oriented perfectionism, the impossibly high standards some of us hold ourselves to. But seldom addressed is what’s been labeled as other-oriented perfectionism, the impossibly high standards some of us hold others to.perfectionistsIn this respect, when the possibility of introspection is presented, perfectionists struggle with ascertaining whether they’re upset with someone because that individual violated some sort of agreement or because of their perfectionism: “Am I asking for too much, or is this person just lazy?” Due to a combination of distorted thinking styles anddefense mechanisms, perfectionists often fail to acknowledge their own contributions to their dysfunctional communication patterns with others. The other’s laziness is a convenient and simple explanation, which absolves the perfectionist of any responsibility to change and thus of the need to feel some degree ofshame.defense mechanismsshameIf I’m perfect and you aren’t, I can continue to view empathy as a weakness, as an undeserved activity that merely perpetuates my being mistreated. In this world, empathy opens the door to manipulation and exploitation, with the perfectionists failing to note how they may be contributing to such horrific activities. As they protect and defend themselves, perfectionists often become that which they claim to disdain. To be fair, there are moments when kindness is exploited, but arguably, to disagree with the recent comments of a notable public figure, a lack of empathy is the real problem, not too much of it.So, if you’re wondering if your perfectionism is the main source of your strife with another, ask yourself:1. Could I be projecting?Do you have a tendency to blame others for something you’re at least in part responsible for? Is your partner or colleague lazy or negligent, or were the expectations vague? Did you maybe even expect them to go above and beyond your negotiated expectations because that’s what you believe you would do? These questions are important because not only may others be unaware of your standards for them, but they may have also never agreed to meet them had they known them from the start. Your standard for a “good employee” may not be universally shared, even if you strongly believe it should be. And not expressing that standard because youfeardisagreement is deceptive.1. Could I be projecting?fear2. Am I mentally filtering or disqualifying the positive?Mental filtering is the process by which you only focus on one side of a particular issue, ignoring or forgetting the other, and disqualifying the positive is the process by which you minimize an important achievement. Here, the perfectionist may leave out the positive aspects of their partner’s or colleague’s contributions. This may cause them to label that individual lazy or ungrateful. Yet, even though they’re apparentlycuttingcorners, the other’s contributions may still be objectively considerable.2. Am I mentally filtering or disqualifying the positive?cutting3. Is this a form of black-and-white thinking?This is related to point number one. Perfectionists tend to struggle with all-or-nothing thinking, thereby discounting anything that isn’t perfect. Here, the perfectionist can assess their standards for others, asking if there are any tolerable mistakes. Often, with introspection, perfectionists may realize that it isn’t one particular thing they’re upset about because they’re unable to tolerate any deviation from their expectations. Returning to the problem of vague agreements, the perfectionist may wish to consider creating clearer standards, which include exceptions.3. Is this a form of black-and-white thinking?4. Am I lacking empathy?Arguably, exceptions are just as important as one’s standards. Perfectionists often fail to express empathy for themselves, conceiving of any explanation for a failure as an excuse, so they, in turn, treat others in kind. Is your employee always late, or are they late sometimes, which feels intolerable to you? Did you consider or even inquire about their lateness, or did you just assume they didn’t care? Cultivating empathy may allow excuses, but it may also increase morale, particularly because the other feels heard and cared for. And doing so indicates an awareness of your own limitations, as you’re no longer just projecting them onto others. If your understanding of human nature is that it’s fundamentally lazy and deceptive, you may want to consider how that perspective contributes to your relationships.4. Am I lacking empathy?What Is Perfectionism?Take our Perfectionism TestFind a therapist near me5. Is any of this adenialof myenvy?Despite the belief that perfectionists merely consider themselves to be superior, they’re often plagued by envy, believing it to be unfair that others are able “to be lazy” while they have to work harder than the rest. Rather than perceiving their own standards as the problem, they often believe those standards are imposed on them by others. Thus, they may project them onto others to balance out the “expected” workload. Rather than conceiving of emotions as normal, perfectionists may single themselves or others out as weak.5. Is any of this adenialof myenvy?denialenvyWe see this tendency currently playing out on a global stage. However, not only do empathy and introspection help others—they help us as well. Many perfectionists will tell you how tiring it is to always be on guard, assuming the worst of others. And they may also note how limited andlonelytheir lives feel. Fortunately, treating others well is the same as being kind to oneself. But doing so takes some introspection and acknowledging needing others.lonely

Why Families Stay the Same, Even When It’s Bad for Them
--- Data ---
There is a phenomenon in familytherapyin which a family will partake in clearly dysfunctional habits that cause conflict, ruptures, and unhappiness, and yet, even when brought to theirattention, they will fight to maintain these habits. This is due to a process called "homeostasis."therapyattentionHomeostasis is a process in which a family utilizes different habits and roles to keepstress, conflict, andanxietywithin "tolerable limits" (Messer, 1971). Each family has their own tolerable limit and will fight to maintain the emotional energy of the family within those bounds. In short, the family will push each other to behave the same as they always had in order to create a predictable environment for themselves, known as a state of "equilibrium."stressanxiety1. The scapegoat or rebel:During family tension, dysfunctional families might try to find a scapegoat. This will be the person they blame for the tension in order to "unite together" against a common, internal enemy. The scapegoat will be seen as the problem, which then dissolves any family responsibility for solving the greater issue.1. The scapegoat or rebel:2. The mediator:At the same time, there is often a mediator. This person takes on the role of helping everyone "get along." They do this by sharing each person's side of the story and asking everyone to agree to disagree. While this can be helpful in some situations, when one person always has to mediate, they are put into a high-stress role in order to get the family back to equilibrium.2. The mediator:3. The "good one":Like finding a scapegoat, the family might also point to the "good one" in the family. This is the person that the scapegoat will be compared against.3. The "good one":1. Defensiveness:To return to homeostasis, or the normal way of being for the family, there is often defensiveness. Defensive behavior limits the ability to see one's role in a situation or begin to consider how to change the pattern.1. Defensiveness:2. Withdrawing:In order to remove oneself from a conversation or to work toward problem-solving, family members might withdraw from the conflict in order to get their way. Because there is so much tension, the other family members will "give up" and return to the status quo.2. Withdrawing:3. Triangulation:In order to push the family back to homeostasis, members of the family will form alliances with each other against whoever is threatening the status quo.3. Triangulation:4.Lying:Family members might lie to each other or use family myths to get people to "behave" within the window of tolerance.4.Lying:Lying5. Resignation:Often, the process of trying to create change causes so much stress that people will resign themselves to the current dynamic.5. Resignation:6. Relentless arguing:Relentless arguing that never goes anywhere reduces the likelihood of change and increases the possibility the family can return to their predicted dynamic.6. Relentless arguing:Families can change their baseline way of functioning when members of the family choose to target and change any one of these roles or behaviors. However, the first person to do so will find that they become the scapegoat as they are seen as responsible for causing a "shake-up," even if the shake-up is for good reason.Family DynamicsFind a Family Therapy TherapistFor this reason, it can be helpful for families to participate in family therapy together, where a therapist can build a relationship with each member of the family that creates a sense of safety so they can drop their defenses while also building up tolerance for change.In the case that family therapy isn't appropriate, it can be helpful to attend individual therapy in order to better understand how the family dysfunction is impacting the individual and what can be done in order to protect oneself against it.

7 Small Ways to Reset and Regulate Your Nervous System
--- Data ---
We are born with a biological survival system that is designed to respond to any environmental or psychological threat presented to us. Ournervous systemis constantly processing information and responding to both internal and external stimuli. It is our first line of defense, working to protect us and keep us safe.nervous systemThe autonomic nervous system, which controls all automatic or involuntary functions of the body, is comprised of two key parts:The sympathetic nervous system:Often referred to as the “fight-or-flight" system, it is responsible for preparing the body for action in response to a perceived threat. It triggers the release of adrenaline and cortisol, activating our automatic survival responses: fight, flight, freeze, or fawn.The sympathetic nervous system:The parasympathetic nervous system:Known as therest and digestsystem, it plays an important role in counteracting the fight-or-flight response and regulating the body’s response to stress. This system promotes relaxation and recovery, helping to bring the body back to a state of calm.The parasympathetic nervous system:rest and digestFrom an evolutionary perspective, our ancestors having a well-tuned fight-or-flight response is how we are here today. This stress system allowed our ancestors to react to and survive life-threatening dangers—predators, food shortages, and extreme weather conditions. The challenge today is that we are using this same system to answer emails, meet deadlines, manage calendars, have conversations, and deal with traffic! Our nervous system hasn’t evolved at the same pace as our modern world. It doesn’t know the difference between a real threat (like a tiger) and a non-life-threatening stressor.Weary Nervous SystemsWhile stress can be healthy for mobilizing us into action and helping us to rise to the challenge, many people today are being pushed beyond an optimal level of stress and into a state of distress. We’re sending our sympathetic nervous system into overdrive because we remain on high alert, constantly reacting to stressor after stressor. We’re not allowing the parasympathetic nervous system time to do its work in relaxing the body. As a result, many of us are not recovering as we need to.Without adequate opportunities to reset and recover, we cross the threshold from manageable stress to distress. Over time, this chronic activation can lead toanxiety, irritability, fatigue, exhaustion, and, inevitably,burnout.anxietyburnoutA Hard ResetRecently, I had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari on a racetrack in the desert. Why not! It was exhilarating,stressful, and epic all at the same time. This high-stakes real-life adventure fully activated my nervous system. My body went into full fight-or-flight mode—my heart pounded, adrenaline spiked, and I was hyper-alert.stressfulAfter the experience, I recognized that my nervous system had fully cycled through the stress response and then naturally returned to baseline.This stark contrast to everyday stressors—the email inbox, to-do lists, meetings—gave me perspective. Suddenly, the everyday stressors didn’t seem so scary. It highlighted just how often we are spending in a heightened state of activation, constantly reacting to stressors that don’t put our survival at risk.Of course, I’m not suggesting that we all need to drive a sports car in the desert to reset our nervous systems. What I am suggesting we can do is find ways we can reset and regulate on a smaller, more sustainable scale.Small Ways to Reset and Regulate the Nervous SystemThere are inevitably going to be moments when our fight-or-flight system is activated. What is important is having strategies to engage the parasympathetic nervous system and bring the body back into balance so we can function optimally. Here are a few ways we can do this:What Is Stress?Take our Burnout TestFind a therapist to overcome stressBreathwork –Physiological sigh –Long exhale breathing –Birthday cake breathing –Movement –Time in Nature –hormonesCrying –Social Connection –Slowing Down –Prioritizing Sleep –How Stress May Increase the Risk of StrokeWell-Being: Be Your Own SuperheroFinal ThoughtsMany of us are spending too much time in a heightened state of activation, constantly reacting instead of responding to the stressors around us. Finding strategies to reset and regulate allows us to return to a more balanced state and show up more well-resourced to handle whatever comes our way next.The goal isn’t to eliminate stress—stress is inevitable. The goal is to learn how to workwithour nervous system so we can navigate stress wisely.withThe next time you feel activated or overwhelmed, ask yourself: What is one small thing I can do right now to support my nervous system?

But they all need the attention of a leader, manager, or supervisor. Superstars want to be recognized and rewarded. Average performers—the vast majority of people—stand the most to gain from consistent coaching, guidance, and support. Low performers are the only ones who don’t want their managers’ attention, but they need it more than anyone.attentionA manager’s primary job is to support employees on all sides of the performance spectrum to do more work, faster, and better.

They want managers who spend enough time with them to teach them the tricks and the shortcuts, warn them of pitfalls, and help them solve problems.

You May Not Belong in the “I’m Not Creative” Group
--- Data ---
“There are two kinds of people in this world: those who divide everything into two groups, and those who don’t.” —Kenneth Boulding, Economist“There are two kinds of people in this world: those who divide everything into two groups, and those who don’t.” —We are a dichotomous society—we often see things in contrasting pairs. We tend to see ourselves as belonging to one group to the exclusion of those folks who belong to an opposing group. And once we assume “membership” in one group, we assume the features or characteristics of all the other members of that group and shun the characteristics of an opposing group. Democrat vs. Republican. Pro-choice vs. pro-life. Gun control vs. gun advocate. Coke vs. Pepsi. McDonalds vs. Burger King. Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants.As a society, we also have a tendency, nay a compulsion, to place others into categories. This is, quite often, done for the convenience of identification. We assign labels to people as a way of understanding them—more specifically, how they are similar to or (more often) different from ourselves. This process begins early in our lives (boys vs. girls, smart vs. dumb) and continues straight through to adulthood (rich vs. poor, liberal vs. conservative). This predilection to group separates people into categories that are easily recognizable, although not always clearly defined.As you might imagine, it is also an arena fraught with danger.Once we assign people—or ourselves—to a group, several things happen. First of all, the group (and the members within that group) assume anidentity. A label is placed on them, a label that, over time, achieves a level of permanency. Once you are a member of a recognized group, you seldom escape the inevitable label that goes along with that group. For example, if you are a “tree hugger,” you will forever be a “tree hugger”—at least as long as you remain in the local community. Once a label has been “assigned,” either by the members of the group or by others not affiliated with the group, it frequently achieves status or permanency.identityNow, let’s advance that argument one step further. If, for example, you have self-assigned yourself as someone who belongs to the “I’m really not creative” group, you tend to view yourself as primarily and permanently uncreative. The more you self-advocate that label, the more that label becomes a constant part of who you are (in your own eyes). The longer you bemoan your “station” in life as someone who is seldom, if ever, creative, the more that label becomes enduringly attached to your psyche. The longer it is in place (as determined by others or by yourself), the more difficult it is to escape.By design, groups also give us the opportunity to be content. If we have self-assigned ourselves to the “I’m not creative” group, then we have also conveniently protected ourselves from moving beyond the borders of that group into new and often unfamiliar territory. Over time, we have become comfortable, contented, and snug in this group. We have eschewed any desire to move out of the group, not only because we have so many like-minded “associates” in the group but also because it offers a safe environment in which to work and play. We have achieved a comfort that is often difficult to overcome and challenging to change. We have labeled ourselves into complacency.But there’s another factor at work here. Sometimes, we are nudged into the “I’m not creative” group by forces that are often subtle and seemingly beyond our control. These “forces” frequently surface in the tens of thousands of books and millions of articles oncreativity. And that is the tendency of many authors to systematically edge us into either the “I’m not creative” group or the “I am creative” group through the use of linguistic manipulations.creativityThere is a tsunami of books and an avalanche of articles that use language such as the following: “Creative people are individuals like Leonardo, Edison, Picasso, or Einstein [who] have changed our culture in some important respect,” “Creative people are the ones who get ahead in their jobs, start new businesses, invent products… paint pictures, and make things of beauty,” and “…creative people need to know a lot about a little and a little about a lot.” Go back and re-read each statement, and you’ll note a familiar term in each one: “creative people.” In using that designation, each author has quietly and subtly injected the idea that there are, indeed, two groups of people on the planet—the creative class and the non-creative class. That is to say, we either identify with one group or the other.Many of those same authors go on to expound on all the qualities, dynamics, and features—often in glowing terms—of those folks who are part of the “Yes, I’m a creative person” group. The appellations and compliments are rampant, and it is clear that this is a singularly unique group inhabited by individuals who not only get a lot of press but also have skills that the rest of us could never aspire to. In reading about these intellectual “Masters of the Universe,” we often, by default, create and assign ourselves to that “other group,” knowing that we lack comparative abilities or a similar intellect.As psychological research has convincingly demonstrated, creativity is not the province of a few but rather the inheritance of all. So, be careful what you read; someone may be grouping you without your knowledge… or consent.“Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties.” —Erich Fromm“Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties.” —

The Art of Reasoning in Psychotherapy

Is it a sign ofimposter syndrome? A learned coping mechanism? A defense against past rejection?imposter syndromeTo navigate such complexities, therapists rely on different modes of reasoning—induction, deduction, and abduction. While induction identifies patterns and deduction applies established theories, abduction generates new explanations, bridging the gap between what is known and possible. This interplay allows therapists to formulate hypotheses, refine interventions, and guide clients toward insight and transformation.Induction: Identifying Patterns in Client NarrativesInduction derives generalizations from specific observations.Therapyinvolves recognizing recurring themes in a client’s experiences or behaviors.TherapyFor example, a therapist who notices a client consistently reporting feelings of dread on Sunday evenings might inferwork-related stress.work-related stressHow Induction Shapes Therapy:Pattern Recognitionself-esteem:cognitive behavioralanxietyInduction highlights patterns but does not explain their root causes, necessitating deduction and abduction.Deduction: Applying Psychological TheoriesDeduction moves from general principles to specific cases.

Growing Up With an Unwell Parent: 3 Paths to Resilience
--- Data ---
Growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness orsubstance abuse(includingalcohol) is a chronicallystressful. This kind ofchildhoodenvironment is associated with later mental health issues includingdepression,anxiety, andPTSD. On top of these issues, children in this situation are vulnerable toshame,bullying, andstigma.substance abusealcoholstressfulchildhooddepressionanxietyPTSDshamebullyingstigmaAt the same time, however, this group of children can also feel compassion, affection, and empathy when they witness their parent struggling, highlighting the complexity of having an unwell parent. Such children can also build theresilienceand coping skills necessary to bounce back from stress and handletraumaticsituations. They may not only survive, but even thrive in the face of adversity.resiliencetraumaticSo, what are the experiences of resilient children whose parents are struggling with mental illness or substance abuse? This was the focus of a study led by Mikael Ahlborg of Halmstad University in Sweden. He and and his team conducted an integrated review, combing through peer-reviewed studies to identify key findings about the resilience of children coping with an unwell parent.The striking results revealed three levels of resilience. The findings are summarized below.A child’s personal resources can help mitigate the stress of having an unwell parent. Traits likeself-efficacy(the belief in one’s ability to manage challenges), self-esteem, and the ability to confide in others were crucial protective factors. Research also found that children with a calm temperament,intelligence, and strong social skills were more likely to develop resilience.self-efficacyintelligenceStudies also revealed that children who used active coping strategies (e.g., problem solving) were less likely to experience symptoms of depression. However, this approach was less common in children with mentally unwell parents compared to their peers. Similarly,optimismand hope for the future were vital.Teenagerswho had cleargoals, like aspirations for highereducationor job opportunities, for example, were better able to cope with their situation.optimismTeenagersgoalseducationChildren and adolescents growing up in households with an unwell parent face challenges, but can also have lifelines in the form of family resources. Certain parental strengths can serve as buffers against these difficulties. For instance, parents who are able to reflect on their own mental health issues and understand how they may affect their children can help to ease their emotional burden. Additionally, when parents are actively engaged in their own treatment and recovery, it can offer hope and stability to a child.Family support — whether from a co-parent, siblings, or extended family members like grandparents or aunts — was also identified as a key source of strength. Siblings often provided each other with emotional support, while extended family members (grandparents, uncles, aunts, etc.) stepped in to help during times when the ill parent was unable to care for the child, such as during hospitalizations.What Is Resilience?Take our Resilience TestFind a therapist near meSupport outside the family plays a crucial role in helping children build resilience and protect their well-being. Teachers, coaches, youth workers, or even police officers served as role models, offering stable and consistent connections that helped children feel supported.However, the findings on formal professional help were mixed. Some preferred not to get too involved in their parents’ mental health issues, while others found familytherapyhelpful in understanding their situation. Research also showed that adolescents who had built relationships with caring professionals over time valued the support, and appreciated that it was available when needed. They also felt that having someone who genuinely cared about their education and future goals was essential to their well-being.therapyWays Communities Can Support Youth Post-DisasterHow True Growth Transforms Your WorldOf note, studies have also shown that when children were educated about available support systems and where to seek additional help, their resilience grew.Ahlborg and his collaborators maintain that growing up with a parent who faces mental illness or substance abuse is undoubtedly challenging, but that children can and do grow resilience. These children face significant emotional and social hurdles, but can also demonstrate strength, empathy, and coping skills that can serve them as adults. In the end, they may not only survive but even thrive in the face of adversity.

The Slow Work of Real Love

In our age of “greatest life hacks” and instant gratification everywhere we turn online, it’s tempting to look for shortcuts, including in your relationship. Just five simple steps to better communication! One powerful phrase to stop every fight! A quick fix for trust issues! Sounds good, right?Wrong.While hacking your morning routine might help you squeeze in a smoothie and ameditation, hacking your relationship is a surefire way to short-circuit something far more complex and essential: human connection. As Vivek Murthy found in his research into the physical cost ofloneliness, we need people and real connections to be our best. Loneliness and disconnection have serious consequences on our health and well-being, not to mention ourproductivityandhappiness.meditationlonelinessproductivityhappinessShortcuts Undermine Long-Term StabilityShortcuts Undermine Long-Term StabilityReal connection thrives on time, presence, and emotional risk. According to Stan Tatkin, , Psy.D., founder of the psychobiological approach to couplestherapy, trust andintimacyaren’t built through grand romantic gestures or clever communication tricks; they’re built through consistent, predictable experiences of safety and reliability. In his bookWired for Love, Tatkin emphasizes that secure-functioning relationships require partners to act as anchors for each other, prioritizing mutual care over individual agendas.therapyintimacyWired for LoveTrying to shortcut this process bypasses the rituals and emotional cues that help partners feel seen, soothed, and safe.

You might get something that looks like bread, but it’s not going to nourish youorsatisfy your craving.boringboringhardorEmotional Bypassing BackfiresEmotional Bypassing BackfiresMany relationship hacks promote surface-level strategies that ignore deeper emotional needs. For example, saying “I hear you” without actuallyhearingyour partner is worse than saying nothing. It’s performative empathy, and most people—especially those in long-term relationships—can smell it a mile away. It ends up hurting the trust and intimacy needed in the vital relationship desired.hearingAs I share inFire It Up, real intimacy isn’t forged in moments of ease—it’s built in the fire of discomfort, vulnerability, and emotional truth-telling. When we try to sidestep conflict or fast-forward to connection, we shortchange the exact process that strengthens us.Fire It UpGrowth lives in the messy middle: the hard conversations, the misunderstandings we work through, the courage it takes to stay open when we want to shut down. There’s no hack for that. Just heart, presence, and a willingness to stay in it. While there are many ways to make these processes easier, there is no getting around the formula for honest growth.Your Partner Isn’t a Problem to SolveYour Partner Isn’t a Problem to SolveThe hack mindset treats relationship struggles like a malfunction: Just push the right buttons, and the system will reboot. But your partner is not a machine, and love is not an algorithm.Attachmenttheory reminds us that our longing for connection is primal and complex.

Making up after a fight that didn’t have a script. These aren’t inefficient—they’re irreplaceable.And before you lose hope that you don’t have time for any of this, these moments are not about the quantity of time spent, they are about the quality of the interaction: our presence, our intention, and our focus. Nothing replaces a moment where both people are focused on connection, whether for three minutes over coffee or three days at a resort together.When Sameness Betrays FairnessWhy Do We Hold on to Old Flames?Connection Requires Courage, Not ClevernessConnection Requires Courage, Not ClevernessIn the end, no relationship hack can replace the brave work of being fully seen. It takes courage to say, “I’m scared you’ll leave me.” Or, “I’m hurt and I don’t know how to talk about it.” That kind of vulnerability can’t be copied and pasted from anInstagrampost. Showing up for yourself in this way takes courage and is matched by the payoff in creating a relationship where you are fully yourself. You have to train each other in showing up, being safe for one another, and how to feed this each day.InstagramIf you’re spending time googling “how to make my partner open up fast,” you’re better off putting down your phone, taking a breath, and asking with real presence, “Can we talk? I want to understand you.”Bottom lineBottom lineIf you're looking for a shortcut to deep connection, you're already off course. The slow way is the fast way—because it's the only way that works.While many powerful things can be done each day to feed your relationship, doing them intentionally to create meaningful change is the real hack. Being intentional about every action we take has the greatest power to influence the power, depth, and strength of our relationship.

How Does Psychedelic Therapy Work?
--- Data ---
As a psychologist who has served as a therapist and site co-principal investigator in clinical trials of MDMA and psilocybin, I'm often asked what conditions psychedelictherapycan treat and how it actually works. While research is still ongoing, we've gained significant insights into both questions.therapyMDMA has demonstrated remarkable potential to treatPTSD, with Phase 3 trials showing significant symptom reduction in patients who hadn't responded to conventional treatments (Mitchell et al., 2021). The therapy appears particularly effective because MDMA can help patients processtraumawithout becoming overwhelmed byfearoranxiety.PTSDtraumafearanxietyPsilocybin has shown promise for several conditions. Fordepression, it appears to help break patterns of repetitivenegative thinkingand provide new perspectives on one's life situation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). In treatingalcoholuse disorder, psilocybin can help people examine their relationship with alcohol and find new meaning that supports recovery (Bogenschutz et al., 2015). For end-of-life anxiety, psilocybin sessions frequently help patients come to terms with mortality and find peace (Griffiths et al., 2016).depressionnegative thinkingalcoholKetamine, already in clinical use, provides rapid relief from severe depression, often helping people who haven't responded to traditionalantidepressants. (Feder et al., 2014). While the immediate effects are attributed to ketamine's biochemical properties, ketamine-assisted therapy can create a window of opportunity for meaningful psychological work.KetamineantidepressantsPsychedelic therapy operates on multiple levels—biological, psychological, and experiential. At the biological level, the medicines affect the networks within the brain that are involved in the regulation of mood, thought, and emotional processing. They often increase neuroplasticity, making the brain more amenable to change (Ly et al., 2018).Psychologically, the treatments appear to work through several mechanisms. They can help people access and process emotional material that's usually difficult to reach. They often provide new perspectives on longstanding problems. And they frequently generate meaningful experiences that help people revise their understanding of themselves and their challenges.The experiential aspect of psychedelic therapy is unique. Unlike traditionalpsychiatricmedications that work in the background, psychedelic sessions often involve profound subjective experiences.psychiatricThese might include:Unlike with some medicines–for instance, antibiotics or vaccines–the effectiveness of psychedelic therapy doesn't come from the biochemical properties of psychedelics alone. Instead, the social and therapeutic context is crucial. Those administering treatment create careful preparation, support during sessions, and integration afterward. This "container" helps people make meaning from their experiences and translate insights into lasting change.During preparation, therapists help people understand what to expect and set intentions for their healing. In psychedelic sessions, therapists provide steady, compassionate presence while ensuring physical and psychological safety. Integration sessions help people process their experiences and apply insights to daily life.Discomfort and Emotional Wisdom with Psychedelic TherapyUnlocking Inner Change With Psychedelics: Tools, Not MagicWhile the potential of psychedelic therapy is exciting, it's important to understand its limitations and contraindications. Psychedelic treatments aren't appropriate for everyone. Careful screening considers such factors as cardiovascular health, psychiatric history, and current medications.Additionally, timing matters. Patients often need to be in a stable life situation to benefit fully from the treatments, particularly during the crucial integration process. Support systems, life circumstances, and readiness for change all influence outcomes.One of the most crucial aspects of psychedelic therapy is the process of making meaning from psychedelic experiences and translating insights intobehavioral change, known as psychedelic integration. While the medicine sessions can be profound, the real work often happens in the days and weeks that follow.behavioral changeIntegration might involve:Research continues to yield new information about how to optimize psychedelic treatments for different conditions. It is revealing which approaches work best for specific populations and how to maximize safety and efficacy.The field is also exploring questions about optimal frequency of sessions, the role of different therapeutic approaches, and how to best support long-term benefits. As these treatments move toward wider availability, understanding their mechanisms helps clinicians implement them most effectively.Psychedelic therapy represents a novel approach to mental health treatment, working through unique biological and psychological mechanisms. While not a panacea, the treatments offer new possibilities for conditions that often resist conventional approaches. As new understanding of how they work emerges, their potential for healing can be harnessed while appropriate safety and care standards are maintained.

4 Reasons Why Partners Cheat in Healthy Relationships
--- Data ---
It’s one of the most perplexing betrayals—when someone in a seemingly happy relationship strays. Conventionalwisdomsuggests that people cheat because something is missing: passion has faded, communication has broken down, or resentment has taken root. But the truth is, many affairs happen not out of dissatisfaction, but for far morecomplex emotional reasons.wisdomcomplex emotional reasonsSome people cheat despite loving their partner. They may deeply value their relationship and still find themselves drawn toinfidelity. This contradiction can be confusing for both the betrayed partner and even the person who cheated themselves. Why does this happen? What hidden forces drive someone to risk something they cherish?infidelityHere are four deeper psychological factors behind why some people cheat, even in happy relationships.Romantic loveis deeply tied to the brain’s dopaminergic reward system, the sameneuralnetwork that drivesmotivation, pleasure, and reinforcement. In the early stages of a relationship, this system is highly active, flooding the brain withdopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for the intoxicating rush ofattraction. Every glance, touch, and late-night conversation feels electric, reinforcing the desire to pursue and focus on a specific partner.Romantic loveneuralmotivationdopamineattractionBut over time, this initial high fades.Researchusing fMRI scans has shown that romantic love transitions from a dopamine-fueled motivation system to a more stable,attachment-driven state supported byoxytocinand vasopressin,hormonesthat deepen trust and bonding. While this shift is natural and necessary for lasting commitment, some people struggle with the loss of early-stage excitement.ResearchattachmentoxytocinhormonesFor those who crave constant stimulation, an affair can feel like a quick way to reintroduce that intoxicating new love feeling. This doesn’t mean they want to leave their relationship—many people who cheat still feel deeply connected to their partner. But the temptation of an exhilarating, risk-fueled experience can override their better judgment.Instead of seeking novelty outside the relationship, one can actively reignite their dopamine-driven excitement. The same reward pathways that create initial attraction can be stimulated through shared new experiences, such as surprising each other, traveling spontaneously, exploring new hobbies together, or deepening intimacy in fresh ways. Romantic love doesn’t have to lose its intensity over time, it simply requires intentional effort to keep the brain engaged and excited within the relationship.Paradoxically, some people cheat not because they feel disconnected, but because they feel too connected. For individuals with avoidant attachment tendencies, deep emotional intimacy can feel overwhelming, triggering fears of losing autonomy, becoming too dependent, or exposing vulnerabilities they’ve long protected.Why Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsThose who grew up in environments where love was conditional, inconsistent, or even harmful may have learned that closeness leads to pain. As a result, true intimacy, where they are fully seen and emotionally invested, can feel unsettling.Cheating, then, becomes anunconsciousway to create distance, allowing them to regain a sense of emotional control. The affair isn’t necessarily about the other person—it’s about buffering themselves from the vulnerability of deep commitment. A new, less-intense connection can feelsaferthan the emotional exposure required in a long-term bond.unconscioussaferA 2013studypublished inSocial Psychological andPersonalityScienceoffers insight into how to navigate thisfearand bridge the attachment gap. The study highlights two key findings:studySocial Psychological andPersonalitySciencePersonalityfearBuilding trustSupporting a partner’s personal growthanxietyWhen Sameness Betrays FairnessWhy Do We Hold on to Old Flames?True security in relationships doesn’t come from avoiding dependence but from recognizing that love and personal autonomy can coexist.Long-term relationships bring two lives together—routines intertwine, identities shift, and priorities blend. While this can foster deep connection, it can also lead to anidentitycrisis, especially for those who strongly associateself-worthwith independence, spontaneity, or adventure.identityself-worthOver time, some may feel they’ve lost touch with the version of themselves they used to be—the person who was single, carefree, or exploratory. They might begin to see themselves more as a partner than as an individual, leading to a sense of stagnation.Researchon the self-expansion model suggests that people have a fundamental motivation to broaden their sense of self, either by deepening relationships or by pursuing new, stimulating, and challenging experiences. When this innate drive for self-expansion is unfulfilled within the current relationship, individuals may seek it elsewhere, including through infidelity.ResearchCheating, in this case, isn’t necessarily about rejecting a relationship but about reclaiming a lost sense of self. The affair becomes a misguided attempt at self-exploration, a way to recapture freedom, desirability, or excitement that seems absent in daily life. However, research suggests that self-expansion doesn’t require stepping outside the relationship—it can thrive within it.Rather than seeking individuality through infidelity, cultivate personal growth inside the relationship. Engage in hobbies that are just for you, maintain friendships outside the partnership, and carve out solo experiences that reinforce your independence. The key to a fulfilling relationship isn’t sacrificing autonomy—it’s ensuring that love and personal growth coexist, rather than compete.Some people cheat not because they are unhappy, but because they don’t believe they deservehappiness. When someone has grown up in a chaotic or emotionally unstable environment, a healthy, secure relationship can feel foreign, even unsettling. Instead of embracing stability, they subconsciously anticipate its end and take preemptive action to disrupt it.happinessA 2010studyon attachment development andemotional abusesuggests that individuals who experience rejection, control, or hostility inchildhoodoften develop insecure attachment styles, which impairemotional regulation, create negative self-perceptions, and interfere with the ability to sustain intimacy. If love was unpredictable in early life, they may internalize the belief that happiness is temporary, love always comes with betrayal, or stability is too good to last.studyemotional abusechildhoodemotional regulationAs a result, when they find themselves in a fulfilling relationship, they may feel disoriented or anxious, waiting for something to go wrong. Infidelity, in this case, becomes an unconsciousdefense mechanism—a way to reaffirm their internal belief that relationships always end in pain. By sabotaging their happiness, they regain a sense of control over an outcome they already fear.defense mechanismA similar version of this post also appears on Forbes.com.A similar version of this post also appears on Forbes.com.

Beyond Happiness: What Science Says About a Flourishing Life
--- Data ---
What if the pursuit ofhappinessisn’t the answer to living a fulfilling life? In a world where happiness is often framed as the ultimate goal, emotions like sadness,anger, andfearare frequently seen as obstacles to be avoided or fixed. This mindset can make happiness feel like an elusive ideal, pushing many into a constant cycle of striving to “find” it. But science suggests that the problem isn’t that we’re failing toachievehappiness—it’s that happiness was never the right goal to begin with.happinessangerfearachieveMany people chase happiness as though it’s a permanent state to reach, yet research shows that emotions are naturally transient. "Happiness isn’t something we achieve and hold onto—it’s a dynamic experience that shifts over time,” says Dr. Joanna Hong, a senior scientist at Healthy Minds Innovations.Chief Science Officer Dr. Raquel Tatar explains that in her native language, Portuguese, there are two words for “happy”:felizandcontente. Feliz conveys a more intense, fleeting burst of joy, while contente speaks to a quieter sense of peace and contentment.felizcontenteDr. Tatar shares that she personally resonates with contente—this preference echoes a deeper truth explored in psychological and scientific research: that happiness and well-being are not the same thing. True well-being is often rooted in consistent, long-term contentment rather than the pursuit of brief moments of happiness. While feliz is wonderful in its moments, contente offers a steadier, more reliable foundation for our well-being and a fulfilling life.“Happiness, like all emotions, signals something important within us or our environment," says Dr. Tammi Kral. "It can draw ourattentionin and heighten our memories…and while these brief moments of happiness may relate to long-term well-being, they alone don’t define it. Mistaking short-term happiness for flourishing can negatively affect our health, relationships, and overall well-being.”attentionSo what if, instead of chasing happiness, we aimed for flourishing?Research shows that humanflourishing—a deeper, more sustainable form of well-being—is not about feeling good all the time. Research from leadingneuroscientistDr. Richard J. Davidson highlights that flourishing is multidimensional1, encompassing more than just happiness. As data and behavioral scientist Dr. Sasha Sommerfeldt further explains, it “involves deeper factors, like having a sense of purpose, positive relationships, and feeling empowered.”flourishingneuroscientistFlourishing extends beyond fleeting positive emotions. "It is very possible, and oftentimes more appropriate, to feel a negativeemotionand still have a high level of overall well-being," says Dr. Tatar. Experiencing difficult emotions is not a sign of failure; rather, it is a natural part of a healthy and adaptive emotional life. Dr. Davidson reminds us that “there are events in our world that are occasions for sadness and other emotions, and we can still be flourishing during those times.”emotionFlourishing isn't just about maximizing happiness, but about cultivating a life rich in meaning, connection, andresilience. As Dr. Hong explains, "Just like our muscles grow stronger with exercise, our emotional resilience builds through each challenge we face—this isn't just uplifting; it's a crucial call to action to engage fully with all emotions, recognizing that the full range of our experiences, from joy to adversity, enhances our psychological and physical health."resilienceScientific research across many institutions supports the idea that true well-being is not about avoiding negative emotions, but about building the skills to navigate them. The team at HMI focuses on four key trainable skills that contribute to long-term flourishing based on aHealthy Minds Framework:Healthy Minds FrameworkAwarenessConnectionInsightPurposeWhy Purpose Is the Opposite of ProductivityDoes Money Really Make Us Happier?By strengthening these areas, individuals can build a foundation for well-being that persists beyond temporary emotional states like happiness.Flourishing is not about constantly seeking happiness but about cultivating the skills that allow for resilience, purpose, and deep well-being. Remember, it's OK not to feel happy all the time. True well-being is about embracing the full spectrum of human experience and engaging with life as it is.

Just Stop! Why Willpower Is Not the Solution to BFRBs
--- Data ---
Body-focused repetitive behaviors(BFRBs), such as hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and skin-picking (excoriation disorder), are often misunderstood. One of the most pervasive and harmful myths about BFRBs is the idea that people engaging in them could simply “just stop” if they tried hard enough. This assumption not only contradicts the lived experiences of those with BFRBs but is also refuted by an emerging body of scientific research.Body-focused repetitive behaviorsBFRBs are neurobiologically driven, involving dysfunction in brain systems related tohabit formation, cognitive flexibility, and reward processing. A 2022 study found that individuals with trichotillomania and skin-picking disorder showed reduced activation in the right basal ganglia during learning tasks—particularly in the putamen, a region involved in habit learning and motor control (Dougherty et al., 2022).habit formationAdditionally, dysregulation in reward circuitry has been implicated in BFRBs. One functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that individuals with BFRBs displayed hyperactivation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus during reward anticipation compared to controls. Increased activation was also observed in regions such as the fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus during loss anticipation, indicating altered reward-processing mechanisms (Grant et al., 2022). These findings highlight that BFRBs are underpinned by altered brain function, not a lack of willpower.These neurobiological insights help explain why many people with BFRBs feel intense urges to engage in these behaviors, even when they desperately want to stop.BFRBs are often reinforced by the immediate temporary relief they provide from uncomfortable internal experiences, such as thoughts, emotions, or sensations/urges. This short-term reward cycle essentially trains the brain to repeat the behavior, strengtheningneuralpathways that make BFRBs automatic over time, despite unwanted longer-term consequences, such as hair loss or skin lesions. This reinforcement loop is why many feel defeated when told they should “just stop”—because it dismisses the powerful neurological mechanisms at play.neuralHRTCognitive BehavioralTherapySuggesting that someone with a BFRB “just stop” doesn’t motivate change—it reinforcesshame. Many people with these conditions already blame themselves, and the cultural narrative aroundself-controlonly adds to their suffering.shameself-controlUnderstanding that BFRBs are rooted in brain function—not character flaws—opens the door to compassion and effective care.BFRBs are complex disorders that require nuanced, evidence-based approaches—not simply willpower. The belief that individuals can stop these behaviors if they “just try harder” isn’t only wrong—it’s harmful.If you or someone you care about is struggling with a BFRB, remember that you're not alone.

Your Brain's Resistance to Lucid Dreaming
--- Data ---
When I was 7, I dreamt that my brother and I were being abducted. As the men were taking us away, I realised that I was dreaming, and I turned to my brother and said, “I’m going to kick him and break free, it’s only a dream.” He then looked me in the eyes in a time-freezing moment and said, “Don’t, because sometimes dreams can come true.”This dream stayed with me mainly because when I woke up in the morning, I was kicking myself for not exploring the dream further. Even as I became lucid, my dream tried to convince me not to meddle with it. Years later, when I trained inlucid dreaming, I encountered this resistance again. On the third night of training, I noticed something odd about my wristband, which readAm I Dreaming?The letters were strangely large, as if melting. When I asked a dream character if we were in a dream, he laughed and told me not to be crazy. “All we need to do,” he insisted, “is take your wristband to a watch repair shop.” I nodded along, not wanting to seem crazy, and missed my chance at becoming lucid in this dream.lucid dreamingAm I Dreaming?The Brain’s ResistanceThe Brain’s ResistanceWhen you question reality in a dream, your brain will come up with various ways of convincing you that the dream, in fact, is very much real. Dream characters can often take on this role, actively convincing you that what you’re experiencing is real, and evenshamingyou for thinking otherwise.shamingOne of the lucid dreamers I interviewed for mystudyshared a fascinating interaction with a dream character who insisted that he, too, experienced dreams. In this lucid dream, the character argued that not only was the dreamer part of his dreams, but that their realities were intertwined, blurring theboundarybetween creator and creation. Another lucid dreamer described a nightmare in which a friend claimed that their waking life was the dream, while the nightmare itself was reality. He shared, “Every time I told him that was impossible, that my wife and son were real, etc., he would say no, they're a creation of your dream. This is what's real.”studyboundaryThis resistance isn’t random. Your brain creates dream characters and scenarios to simulate realities, often pulling fromsubconsciousassociations and memories. These responses can be surprising, even to the dreamer, because they operate outside of your immediate conscious awareness.subconsciousWhy the Resistance?Why the Resistance?Some researchers propose that dreams function as a virtual reality environment where the brain can rehearse and simulate various scenarios, serving an evolutionary purpose. The threat simulation theory suggests that dreams create a space to practice responses to threatening situations, enhancing survival skills by preparing individuals for real-life dangers. Frequent encounters with threats in dreams, according to this theory, are adaptive, honing the ability to cope with challenges in the waking world. Similarly, the social simulation theory emphasises the role of dreams in rehearsing social interactions. By simulating complex social environments, dreams help individuals navigate relationships, develop social competence, and enhanceemotional intelligence. According to these theories, believing that dreams are real while in them is quite important, which may explain why the brain resists disruptions like lucidity.emotional intelligenceRelying on Your SensesRelying on Your SensesThe key to navigating this resistance is to rely on your senses, not the logic of dream characters or their attempts to dissuade you. Here’s how to overcome the resistance:Reality ChecksRecognise Resistancethe environmentLeverage Dream IncubationThe next time you hear, “Don’t be crazy, this isn’t a dream,” let it be your cue to question everything. By rehearsing this mindset, you can train your brain to use this resistance in your favour.

How Families Can Foster Children’s Well-Being Post-Disaster
--- Data ---
Families play a central role in how children adapt post-disaster. Beyond the initial impact of a natural or human-caused disaster, the ongoing recovery environment, of which the family is central, can either help or hinder a child’s recovery orresiliencepost-disaster (Bonanno et al., 2010). For children, how their parents and family are functioning has a strong relationship to their mental health, as they look to their caregivers for how to cope and manage emotions.resilienceBonanno et al., 2010But how can parents best support their children’s mental health post-disaster when they, too, are coping with their own experiences and losses? As parents navigate a new chapter in their family story, psychological science can offer guidance to help families adapt following a disaster.Beyond the degree of disaster exposure itself, parents’ post-disaster mental health is one of the bigger influences on their children’s mental health (Felix et al., 2013). For the families with the most disaster-related losses and stressors, parents may feel too busy managing relocation if they have to move, repair, or rebuild and/or find work if their jobs were affected to take care of themselves and their mental health. But it is one of the best things they can do to help their children.As with airline safety, in the event of an emergency, a person needs to put on their own oxygen mask before they can help others. Therefore, if a parent is feeling chronicallystressedand overwhelmed, please be proactive and get support, as it can benefit the whole family system.stressedThe quality of family relationships is important to children’s mental health in general, but it can be even more so following a disaster. Disaster science shows that better family relationships can protect against the risk of long-term mental health problems in children post-disaster. For example, research with 1,886 parent-child dyads following a hurricane in Puerto Rico found that parent-child relationship quality helped protect against clinical levels ofanxietyanddepressionamong children and youth (Felix et al., 2013).anxietydepressionFelix et al., 2013Disasters also can stress and burden parents’ partner or spousal relationships, and this can be felt by adolescents and influence their long-term well-being (Felix et al., 2013). Beyond parents seeking mental health support when needed, communities can do tangible things to support families and help alleviate some stress. For example, community organizations can provide safe, fun, free, or low-cost events for children and youth that can free up parents’ time to manage the tasks of rebuilding or to have a date night to keep the partner unit strong. Similarly, free and low-cost events that parents and children can do together can help them take a break from the stress, enjoy one another’s company, and strengthen bonds.If families want help promoting strong relationships following a disaster, there are evidence-based programs that have been adapted for families dealing with disaster, such as Disaster Recovery Triple P (Cobham et al., 2016) and Respond with CARE (Child Adult Relationship Enhancement), which was modified from a program for foster families (Messer et al., 2018).What Is Resilience?Take our Resilience TestFind a therapist near meParents also want to know how to talk with their children about the disaster experience and the ongoing stressors encountered in the recovery and rebuilding process. Research with parents following the Boston Marathon Bombing (Carpenter et al., 2015) found that in the immediate impact phase, it was helpful to have caregivers inform the child of the facts of the attack versus learning through the media, having caregivers expressconfidencein their safety, and to discuss their own feelings in a calm manner. It was unhelpful to have caregivers avoid discussions of the event altogether or express excessive concern about their safety.Carpenter et al., 2015confidenceBeyond the initial impact phase, our research with families following floods in Texas showed that over the long-term aftermath, two extremes should be avoided—topic avoidance, which is not talking about the disaster experience at all, and verbal rumination, which is repeatedly talking about their negative emotions and consequences of the stressor (Felix et al., 2020). These communication styles increase the risk of anxiety and depression in children.Felix et al., 2020Ways Communities Can Support Youth Post-DisasterHow True Growth Transforms Your WorldInstead, parents can communicate early on that they are available to talk and listen when the child wants to, ask open-ended questions, and then follow their child’s lead on what they want to know or discuss. Open-ended questions are useful because parents’ worries may not be what is on the child’s mind, and a parent does not want to implant a worry in a child that they do not have. Reassure children that they are safe and provide factual information when asked.Talking about what the community is doing to address safety or recovery can help foster hope that this is temporary and the future can be better. Checking in regularly with children about how they are doing, especially if they had to change schools, had friends move away, or lost a pet, can help children know it is OK to talk about their feelings and to ask for help if needed.By parents taking care of themselves, doing what they can to communicate well, and fostering strong relationships, families can support their children on their road to resilience or recovery following disaster.

Learning to Think in a Made-Up World
--- Data ---
We are living in a chaotic time with global upheavals, political realignments, quickening technological advancement, and information overload. Further,AIis developing at an accelerated pace. We are exposed to more deepfakes, misinformation, and conspiracy theories, making it difficult to distinguish what is true and what is made up. Not only are these facets destabilizing, but they also combine to create an environment that is difficult for people to think about critically, limits questioning about its basic assumptions, and interferes with objectivity in analyzing what is being seen, heard, read, and believed (Cinelli et al., 2021; O’Callaghan et al., 2015).AIThe way we gather our news and learn about the world has changed, reducing the depth and breadth of the information we take in. The overwhelming flood of available content means we now tend to acquire information via “brief formats,” such associal mediaand headlines. Internet algorithms further narrow knowledge, prioritizing content that a person is most likely to click on, reinforcing existing beliefs, and limiting exposure to diverse points of view. Easily digestible content discourages users from critically analyzing complex topics and encourages tribalism over nuanced debate.social mediaCritical thinking is on the decline (Ranschaert, 2020). Critical thinking is the ability to logically evaluate and interpret information to make reasoned and informed judgments about its factuality and relevance. Critical thinking is the process where, rather than accepting assertions at face value, you question assumptions, recognize biases, look for non-confirming evidence, and evaluate different perspectives using evidence-based data to reach the most objective conclusion possible.We live in a “post-truth” environment that encourages people to believe what “feels true” rather than that which is validated by evidence and empirical data. Political, dogmatic, media, and corporate agendas fuel this approach, making us all more vulnerable to propaganda and manipulation. Authoritarian motivations of governments and corporate interests stem from the desire for power through control. Religious and ideological groups may demand faith over critical thinking. These motivations erode deep thinking through the suppression of dissent and a preference for strict hierarchies, obedience, and loyalty over independent thought.While critical thinking is declining, AI systems are expanding their penetration. We are witnessing an explosion of extraordinarily capable AI tools that make it simple to find quick answers without bothering with deep analysis. This results in “cognitive offloading,” that is, using external tools to reduce cognitive load for mental tasks (Gerlich, 2025). While the ease of technology tools is appealing, their use comes at a cost. A reduction in critical thinking leads to a reduced individual capacity for making good decisions, problem-solving, and adaptability.Critical thinking is more than a skill, it is a requirement to defend yourself against misinformation and manipulation. Critical thinking is the way we can logically weigh evidence, consider our beliefs, and make informed choices and judgments. When we are able to break down complex issues and mull over various perspectives, it fortifies our problem-solving capabilities for navigating daily challenges and addressing unexpected circumstances.Critical thinking enhances our ability to adapt to dynamic events and persevere when things get tough. It protects us against misinformation, helping us distinguish between reliable sources and deceptive assertions. When we engage in independent analysis and articulate our ideas, it gives us a better understanding of the issues, increases empathy, and is more likely to inspire innovation. Moreover, critical thinking helps us minimize biases, build creative skills, and improve relationships and communications (Moustaghfir & Brigul, 2024).Specifically, critical thinking helps us become more skeptical and logical so we are less vulnerable to scams, deepfakes, and misinformation. Scammers use cognitive biases and emotional provocation (like greed,fear, scarcity, and urgency) to pressure people into falling for their tricks. Critical thinking can help you ferret out scams, determine if an offer is too good to be true, and recognize when you are being manipulated into acting quickly.fearFurther, we become less susceptible to deepfakes when we learn to scrutinize images, look for inconsistencies, and seek validation before believing what we see. Finally, we are more likely to spot misinformation when we make determinations based on empirically supported facts rather than beliefs and emotional reactions that can easily be triggered by confirmation biases.CognitionRigid Thinking Fuels Both Eating Disorders and PTSDSlow Brains and Fast TigersThere are many ways that we can enhance our critical thinking, both at the individual and societal levels. Individually, you can resolve to question everything rather than taking information at face value. Questioning everything includes questioning your own thinking, asking: “Why do I believe this?”Resist over-relying on AI. Instead, read material from diverse sources, intentionally consider different opinions, and compare the information before drawing conclusions. This requires breaking complex issues down into smaller bits for analysis and comparing different points of view while remaining cognizant of biases that might be influencing your judgments.Learn a “devil’s advocate” approach to thinking. That is, learn how to argue from both sides of a debate in order to fully understand the topic. Stay open-minded and be willing to change your beliefs when you are presented with strong empirical evidence.Countering the societal suppression of critical thinking requires efforts on multiple fronts. We need to build an educational system that combats censorship and champions inquiry-based learning, media literacy, and ethical reasoning. Full access to diverse information, such as independent journalism and open-source knowledge, is essential to prevent gatekeeping that constricts a robust information pipeline.Teachingmindfulness,emotional regulation, and cognitiveresiliencecan help to counter the fear and emotional manipulation from those interests seeking power and control. We need to become aware of psychological tactics, like fear-mongering and false dichotomies, that are often implemented by these interests. There are grassroots efforts that can help as well, such as supporting watchdog organizations, boycotting companies that rely on monopolistic control and exploitative practices, and demanding government transparency.mindfulnessemotional regulationresilienceWe can also build community learning spaces that support the development of critical thinking skills outside of formaleducation. Simply explaining a complex issue to another person can promote critical thinking by bringing fallacies and superficial reasoning to the surface. If you struggle in your explanation or find inconsistencies or biases, you will know you need to analyze the issue at a deeper level.educationCritical thinking is not about knowing the facts; it is about learning to question everything. It is a skill that can be strengthened and a habit that can be reinforced. Critical thinking gives us a defense against manipulation and misinformation. Critical thought, based on diverse, empirical information, promotes a myriad of other capacities, including problem-solving,creativity, empathy, ethical reasoning, and self-awareness. Critical thinking empowers us to navigate the complexities of modern living and make informed, thoughtful decisions, and it can lead to more just and resilient societies.creativity

There is much to be gained frommeditation– fromstress managementto enhancedself-compassion. However, one of meditation’s key effects has to do withun-doingrather than acquiring anything. Specifically, the un-learning of habitual thought patterns.meditationstress managementself-compassionun-doingIn theirmany to (n)one theory, cognitive neuroscientists Heleen Slagter and Ruben Laukkonen propose that byanchoringthe practitioner in the present moment, meditation “reins in” the brain’s deep, predictive processing that gives rise to automatic thoughts. Over time, this disruption of habitual thinking could lead to less rumination and greater cognitive flexibility in daily life.many to (n)one theoryanchoringreins inTheir theory, which aligns with insights from Buddhist psychology, is rooted in thepredictive brain framework.In this framework, the brain is viewed as an organ that repeatedly “regurgitates the world” and reconstructs its version of reality based on predictions it makes from past experiences.predictive brain framework.regurgitates the worldThe Predictive Brain HypothesisOur brains don’t have direct access to the external world. In order to figure out (to predict) what is “out there” and interpret the incoming flow of sensory input, the brain relies on past experiences to create a model of reality. To function efficiently, the brain reducesprediction errors,by minimizing the gap between its predictions and sensory data.

Evenanxietycould be driven as a habit, by triggering worry as a mental behavior. As such, while the predictive ability of the human brain is important for our survival, it can get stuck in habitual cognitive and emotional patterns. As Slagter explains, an overly rigid mind can be maladaptive.cognitionpatternsattentionattentionanxietyThoughts and constraintsAs a species, we have sworn our loyalties to thinking. Whether we realize it or not, we spend the majority of our awake moments in the company of our thoughts. Ironically, we often encounter their relentless ubiquity during meditation. It’s in stillness that themonkey mind– the Buddhist description of the ever-restless mind that leaps from one thought to another – becomes most evident.monkey mindThe thousands of thoughts we have every day (over 6,000, according to a recent fMRIstudy) can be categorized along two dimensions of constraints:deliberate(how goal-oriented they are) andautomatic(how habitual or involuntary they become). These constraints serve to putlimitson the content and dynamics of our thoughts. For example, when thoughts spontaneously go in different places (i.e.,mind-wandering), they are low on constraints. On the other hand,ruminationis high on automatic constraints, whileplanningis high on deliberate constraints.studydeliberatedeliberateautomaticautomaticautomaticlimitsmind-wanderingmind-wanderingruminationplanning“When we mentally rehearse actions, like planning a trip to the supermarket, we are directing our attention in certain ways inside our minds. By reinforcing specific attentional patterns, we are putting constraints on them, so thoughts automatically behave in certain ways. This process of mental learning creates“dents” in our mental landscape, that over time add up to “valleys.” This influences future thoughts and emotions, shaping the way we think and feel in predictable ways,” explains Slagter.Regardless of its type, thinking uproots us out of the present moment flow of sensory data and drops us into the (at times murky) waters ofcounterfactual cognition– the ability to mentally simulate possible realities. While our inclination to continuously revisit the past and the hypothetical future has its adaptive advantages, it can also contribute to oursuffering.counterfactual cognitioncounterfactual cognitioncounterfactual cognitionsufferingUn-doing constraints through meditationAccording to Slagter, meditation can remove these constraints and make automatic patterns of thoughts more flexible. Considermindfulnessoropen awareness meditation– a style of meditation where practitioners are instructed to allow thoughts and sensations to come and go, without judgment, preference or pushing away. By reducing engagement with habitual thought patterns, the “dents” and “valleys” of the metal landscape are flattened. Over time, this loosens the grip of automatic constraints and expands the brain’s predictive capacity.mindfulnessopen awareness meditation5 Micro-Meditations to Reduce StressWhy Meditation Can Be an Essential Hack for Anyone“Mindfulness differs from regular modes of attention, since it’s non-selective, non-goal-directed and stripped-down. This mental inaction may weaken the habitual modes of attending to experience, giving us more mental freedom to think and respond in other ways. Over time, this un-learning can lead to broadening the ways in which we think, feel, and perceive,” says Slagter.Pruning the treeSlagter and Laukkonen use the metaphor of thePythagoras Treeto illustrate the hierarchical way in which the brain processes and represents the information it receives. Input is first registered in direct, precise, raw form (e.g., a round, hollow object) before being interpreted through increasingly abstract, complex, conceptually-rich layers of meaning (e.g., a golden wedding ring symbolizing years of partnership through life’s ups and downs). As we move higher in this hierarchy – like climbing the branches of a tree – we “abstract away” from the direct experience of the present moment and drift further into the depth of the tree, into the intricate web of branches and foliage.Pythagoras Treeabstract awayMeditation counteracts this abstraction by continuously directing attention back to immediate sensory experiences. When we rest our attention on the breath, sounds, or bodily sensations, giving everything that arises equal (low) precision, and staying in a state of non-judgmental observing, we can let go of the automatically arising predictions without grasping, thus interrupting the brain’s habitual tendency toconceptualize.conceptualizeAs Laukkonen and Slagterpostulate, to fully inhabit the present moment, the brain must disengage from its usual anticipatory processes. In doing so, one glimpses an “unconditioned” state of awareness that exists before thoughts and emotions take hold.postulateunconditionedRather than being swept away by habitual narratives, one can more skillfully stay with the raw sensory data as it comes in. In this way, by resting in awareness without reinforcing any particular thoughts, meditation “deconstructs” habitual thinking patterns and reduces the brain’s reliance on past-driven predictions. Laukkonen and Slagter (2021) describe this process as “pruning the counterfactual tree.”deconstructsBefriending the mindThere are various possible benefits of this temporary reduction in the brain’s high-level counterfactual processing. One of them, according to Slagter, is enhanced cognitive flexibility. If we are are no longer at the mercy of learned mental habits, our brains become open to conjure a broader range of thought patterns. In fact, it “may be one way to revise the immense multiplicity of thoughts to those that are adaptive to one’sgoals” write Laukkonen and Slagter (2021).goalsThe renowned Tibetan meditation teacher Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche suggests that the best way to deal with the monkey mind is to befriend it.Can we bring curiosity to the monkey’s incessant acrobatics, as it swings from one favorite branch to another?Can we cultivate compassion when it gets lost in the dense foliage?Consider the pointer from psychotherapist and meditation teacher Loch Kelly: “What’s here now when there is no problem to solve.”What’s here now when there is no problem to solveCan we glimpse freedom and respite, if ever for a moment, when the monkey comes down the tree and observes its magnificent canopy from a distance?Many thanks toHeleen Slagterfor her time and insights.

5 Mathematical Reasoning Tools for Clear Everyday Thinking
--- Data ---
Math offers us lots of problem-solving techniques that help us distill the essence of questions.Many of us will be familiar with reading a math problem, and needing to figure out what's being asked, the information we have, the sample space, and what's missing or uncertain.By borrowing techniques from math, we can think more clearly about problems and tasks in our work and broader life.1. Set Upper and Lower Bounds1. Set Upper and Lower BoundsEstimating a range can help you cut through fuzzy overthinking. Frame any problem with a best-case and worst-case scenario. Or, depending on the question at hand, set bounds for the biggest and smallest reasonable choices. This reduces overwhelm and gives you guardrails within which to work. It's like mental scaffolding—practical and calming.Examples:Examples:Examples:When you define upper and lower bounds, it can help you see that perfection and speed aren't a big deal in the grand scheme of things. You can quickly see you'll want to allow 20 minutes to drive to class. Writing the email is a drag but the most it will take is 15 minutes, and you can handle that. Even if you feel confused about the new UI now, it'll feel like second nature in a week.2. Articulate The Brute-Force Solution2. Articulate The Brute-Force SolutionPremature optimization can be a big problem,especially for overthinkers. Before you attempt an optimal solution, first articulate the brute force or inefficient solution.This gives you a starting point, from which you can improve your solution.especially for overthinkersThis gives you a starting pointExamples:Examples:What might be a brute-force solution for each of the following?What might be a brute-force solution for each of the following?Articulating a brute-force solution (what works but involves the most manual effort) helps you understand the problem better, can help you developintuitionfor possible efficiencies, and can help you imagine how you'll deal with edge cases.intuition3. Do a Numerical Sanity Check3. Do a Numerical Sanity CheckIn math, we often want to do a sanity check that helps us see when we might've made a calculation that's an order of magnitude off. For example, you're estimating how much to feed a pet based on its weight. If the calculation comes out as 20 pounds of food per day for a 10-pound cat, it's clearly off.What Does "Self Help" Mean?Take our Self-Esteem TestFind a therapist near meExamples:4. Use An Example You Care About, Or Are Very Familiar With, To Anchor Your Conceptual Knowledge4. Use An Example You Care About, Or Are Very Familiar With, To Anchor Your Conceptual KnowledgeIn probability classes, there are usually umpteen examples related to tossing a coin or rolling a standard six-sided die. These help us understand tricky concepts, like how individual dice rolls have a uniform distribution (each outcome is equally likely), but if we roll several dice and add up the numbers, the pattern starts to resemble a bell curve.Self-HelpHow to Break a Bad HabitThe Danger of Waiting for a Last-Minute Plot TwistWhen there's an abstract principle we want to remember for managing ourselves, or when we need a familiar example to scaffold complex new knowledge, a highly familiar anchor example can help us do that.Examples:Examples:5. Solve a Cousin Problem to Develop Your Intuition5. Solve a Cousin Problem to Develop Your IntuitionI've written beforeabout how solving smaller or larger problems can help us develop intuition for how to approach our actual problem at hand. A variation on this is to solve a cousin problem. The problem might not be completely the same, but thinking through a different problem that intuitively feels similar can help us see potential paths forward.I've written beforeExamples:Examples:friendshipThis point converges with an ideaI've previously written about:there are many patterns that repeat in larger and smaller ways in our lives (like the intricate branching patterns of a fern leaf, where each smaller part resembles the whole). Solving any example of the pattern helps us solve others e.g.,not overthinking small decisionshelps us not overthink important ones.I've previously written about:not overthinking small decisionsThese five mathematical reasoning tools—setting bounds, articulating brute force solutions, running numerical sanity checks, using anchor examples, and solving cousin problems—give us practical ways to distill complex questions. By borrowing these techniques from math, we can cut through mental fog, reduce overthinking, and approach both everyday tasks and significant challenges with greater clarity andconfidence.confidence

Why Couples Struggle With Time-Outs From Conflict
--- Data ---
Taking a time out from conflict is one of the most useful conflictmanagementskills for couples, and yet most couples never use it.managementWe often hear from partners that time-outs don’t work for them. The thing is, they absolutely do work. It’s impossible to keep fighting if you’re taking a time out. However, they are hard to do correctly. When time-outs seem ineffective, it’s usually because of common mistakes in how they’re implemented.If you and your partner struggle with taking time out from conflict, you might be making one of these mistakes:1. Believing That Continuing the Fight Might Be Productive1. Believing That Continuing the Fight Might Be ProductiveMany couples resist taking a break because they believe that if they just keep going, they’ll eventually resolve the conflict. Really? How often has it worked in the past to just keep fighting? If heated arguments rarely lead to resolution for you, they’re unlikely to start being productive now. Taking a time out gives both partners a chance to cool down, regulate emotions, and come back to the discussion with more clarity and composure.2. Waiting Too Long to Call a Time Out2. Waiting Too Long to Call a Time OutA time-out should happen before emotions escalate beyond control. The problem is, many people wait until they’re already emotionally flooded, when rational thinking has left the building. The key is to recognize early warning signs of escalation, like raised voices, defensivebody language, or a racing heartbeat. The sooner you pause the argument, the easier it will be to return to it with a productive mindset.body language3. Feeling Distressed If Conflict Isn’t Resolved Immediately3. Feeling Distressed If Conflict Isn’t Resolved ImmediatelySome people, especially those with an anxiousattachmentstyle, feel deeply uncomfortable leaving a conflict unresolved, even temporarily. If this is you—hey there, fellow pursuers!—it’s crucial to engage in grounding and self-soothing techniques. Remind yourself that disengaging from conflict isn’t avoidance; it’s an investment in a healthier resolution. Try deep breathing, a short walk, or journaling to manage youranxietyduring the break.attachmenthey there, fellow pursuers!anxiety4. Failing to Time-In4. Failing to Time-InA time-out only works if you come back to the conversation at a scheduled time. Otherwise, it’s just avoidance, which can create even bigger problems in the relationship. Before stepping away, agree on a specific time to check back in—whether it’s in 30 minutes or the next day. This reassures both partners that the issue will be addressed and prevents lingering resentment.How do you use this skill properly?Identify your personal "getting upset" scale, and identify signs that indicate you're at around a 5 out of 10—notice thethoughts(you never listen to me),feelings(anger, overwhelm),body sensations(pounding heart, tension), andbehaviorsthat are your cue that it's time to take a time-out.thoughtsyou never listen to mefeelingsangerbody sensationsbehaviorsTogether with your partner, identify the language (time-out, take a break, pause) you'll use to communicate that you're taking a time-out.Alwaysphrase taking a time-out asIorwe, neveryou; we're letting our partner know that we need a break, not that they need to take one.time-out, take a break, pauseAlwaysIweyouRespect the time-out. Even if you want to keep talking, show your partner that you respect them by respecting their time-out. A time-out isn't a negotiation, it only takes one person to call it.Clarify the length of time of the break period. We recommend around 30 minutes as the default, but couples who are good at this can need as little as just a few minutes. For really tough issues, you might need several hours.Identify severalemotion regulationand self-soothing strategies to use during this break. Your job is to get yourself to a productive frame of mind so that you can come back to the conversation with your best communication. Try journaling, going for a walk, deep breathing, exercising, cleaning, or meditating.emotion regulationNo matter what, check in when you said you would. A check-in is a commitment, and keeping it helps your partner learn to trust you. At that point, you might decide:To continue the conversation with cooler heads and a better chance at resolution.To extend the time-out, because one or both of you isn't ready to talk yet. Set a new time-in.To drop the issue, because it was simply a moment of frustration and did not indicate a deeper issue to resolve.To schedule a time to talk later, because it requires more time,attention, or focus than you can spare at the moment.attentionWhen used correctly, time-outs are a powerful tool for conflict resolution. They allow couples to step away from unproductive, emotionally charged exchanges and return with a clearer, calmer perspective. If time-outs haven’t worked for you in the past, consider whether one of these common mistakes is getting in the way. With practice, time-outs can become one of your strongest relationship skills.Why Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsIf you need help with this, reach out to a couples therapist.

How AI Is Redrawing the Map of Cognition
--- Data ---
In the final article in this series, we move from unravelingcognitionto mapping a new conceptual landscape. Over the course of four articles, I’ve examined the dismantling of cognition as a singular model and opened the door to new forms ofintelligence—forms that behave, respond, and adapt without any of the interior scaffolding we’ve historically associated with thought. We’ve traveled from introspection to inference, from reflective minds to distributed behaviors. And now, it’s time to orient this perspective.cognitionintelligenceThis article offers a conceptual framework, a way to make sense of what has emerged. It’s not a hierarchy or timeline. It’s a field or, more accurately, a cognitive ecology. One that maps intelligence not by what it is but by how it manifests—how it moves, coordinates, and expresses. Yet, within this complexity, this model is simple—its quadrant is defined by two axes. On the horizontal, we see cognition evolving into behavior. On the vertical, we trace the shift from local, individual intelligence to collective, networked expression.Let’s begin with the human mind—introspective, symbolic, local—at the lower left. This is where cognition, as we’ve known it, begins. Across from it isextension. That’scognition expressed through skilled performance and expertise—still human, but now embodied and external.extension. That’sAbove human intelligence sitsemergent intelligence—large language models and probabilistic systems that don’t think but generate. They infer, assemble, and surprise. And finally, in the upper right, we finddistributed cognition—decentralized behavioral intelligence. The cognitive DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Intelligence without a thinker. Let’s break that down a bit more.emergent intelligencedistributed cognitionHuman: Symbolic and Introspective —Human intelligence is the ground floor. The symbolic self. It’s wherememory, introspection, andidentitylive. Here, cognition is slow, recursive, and language-bound. It is the birthplace of meaning, but it is also bounded—by perspective, byemotion, by mortality. In this quadrant, we see ourselves.Human: Symbolic and Introspective —memoryidentityemotionExtension: Embodied Intelligence —Extension is what happens when cognition leaves the room. It’s still ours—but it lives in action. A surgeon’s hand. A violinist’s bow. A clinicalintuitionformed over decades. This is intelligence in motion. It doesn’t reflect; it responds. Not blindly, but with precision and intention born of experience. Here, cognition is embodied.Extension: Embodied Intelligence —intuitionEmergent: Generative Without Awareness —Emergent intelligence doesn’t reside in a body or a mind. It generates. It assembles meaning without knowing it. This is where large language models live—not thinking but producing. Not remembering but modeling. There’s no interiority here. No memory palace, just a field of latent connections that light up when prompted. It’s eerie, powerful, and entirely synthetic.Emergent: Generative Without Awareness —Distributed: Intelligence Without a Thinker —Distributed cognition isn’t even modeling anymore. It behaves. Like a DAO, it isn’t located anywhere. There’s no seat of thought. No introspective loop. Intelligence emerges through structure and responsiveness. It acts without knowing, adapts without memory, and coordinates without hierarchy. This isn’t a lesser form of thinking. It’s something else entirely.Distributed: Intelligence Without a Thinker —Taken together, these quadrants form a map—not of what intelligence is, but my hypothetical perspective of what it is becoming. And while they are distinct, they are not separate. Intelligence now exists in a field, not a silo. Human cognition is no longer the whole story. It’s part of a broader ecology.What makes this framework useful is that it doesn’t privilege one form of intelligence over another. It simply locates them. And doing so helps us understand where we are and where we might be headed. The movement from the lower left to the upper right is not a path of progress. It’s a change in topology or a reconfiguration of thought, behavior, and being.Artificial IntelligenceAI Predicts Chemical Makeup From Photos4 Steps to Overcome AI-Induced Imposter SyndromeThe key point is that humans are not being replaced—we are being recontextualized. Intelligence is expanding beyond theboundariesof the mind. And that expansion calls us not to retreat but to adapt.boundariesSo we end here, not with answers, but with a map. A way to see the shifting terrain beneath our feet. And, perhaps, with a quiet invitation. If intelligence no longer lives inside us, does it still belong to us? Or have we entered a new chapter—one where intelligence no longer needs a mind to matter?In this quadrant framework, there is no center—only direction. Intelligence unfolds not from a single point but through interaction, behavior, and structure. It’s no longer a spark within but a pattern among. This realization doesn’t reduce the human role; it reframes it.I argue that we are not the origin of intelligence—we are one of its expressions. And as that expression diffuses, we must find a new kind of participation. Because this isn’t the end of cognition. It’s the beginning of something else—an expanded terrain where intelligence unfolds without introspection and no longer needs a mind to be real.TheCognitive Ageisn’t asking us to think harder. It’s asking us to see differently.Cognitive Age

The Psychology of the True Believer
--- Data ---
When we think about the act of believing, we often think in qualitative terms about whether someone does or doesn’t believe something. Indeed, that’s usually how questions about factual beliefs—like whether or not there’s a God or whether anthropogenicclimate changereally exists—are framed.climate changeBelief can be more accurately understood in quantitative terms based on cognitive dimensions like conviction (how strongly we believe something), preoccupation (how much we think about the belief), and emotional investment (how much we care).In previous blogposts and in my bookFalse: How Mistrust, Disinformation, and Motivated Reasoning Make Us Believe Things That Aren’t True, I have proposed a quantitative model of belief based on5 Stages of Ideological Commitmentin which “ideology” is defined as a group of thematically related factual beliefs, values (beliefs about what’s important), and morals (beliefs about what’s good or bad). According to this model, deepening ideological commitment involves greater belief conviction, preoccupation, and emotional investment, often accompanied by increasing moral judgment.False: How Mistrust, Disinformation, and Motivated Reasoning Make Us Believe Things That Aren’t TrueFalse: How Mistrust, Disinformation, and Motivated Reasoning Make Us Believe Things That Aren’t True5 Stages of Ideological CommitmentWithin the five stages of ideological commitment, “nonbelievers” have ideological beliefs, but they hold them in a mentally healthy way, as probability judgments following the “Holy Trinity of Truth Detection” that includes:Holy Trinity of Truth DetectionDeepening ideological commitment often involves the opposite—intellectual arrogance, cognitive rigidity, and intuitive "gut-level" thinking—so there’s a greater risk of interpersonal conflict based on the insistence that “I’m right and you’re wrong.”“True believers” at the third stage of ideological commitment are those who are no longer “just asking questions” or “looking for answers” the way “fence-sitters” (at the second stage) are, but have found the answers they were looking for. Their level of belief conviction is high and is often well out of proportion to the evidence to justify it.fence-sittersIn addition, their beliefs include not only perceived facts, but strong feelings about what’s important and morally righteous. As a result, their beliefs are not limited to a particular worldview, but also include moral judgments about what other people should believe or how they should act. Although people argue about facts, moral judgments, and the desire to impose one’s beliefs on others, these are often what lies at the heart of conflicts over ideological beliefs.At the true believer stage, ideological beliefs are also used to define one'sidentity. True believers don’t just believeinsomething, they identifyasa believer who often finds a sense of purpose and belonging within an ideological group of like-minded individuals who share that belief. Sometimes a true believer's strong faith, commitment to positive values, and group cohesion result in a sense of greater meaning beyond oneself as well as acts ofaltruismthat can be rewarding and healthy.identityinasaltruismBut for true believers, there’s also a potential dark side when their beliefs conflict with those outside their ideological group.Cognitive dissonance—the tension that arises when one’s belief butts up against reality or counter-opinions—is typically resolved by doubling-down on belief conviction and hardening one's resolve. And when belief and identity become fused, a perceived attack on one’s belief is experienced as an existential threat to both the true believer as well as their “people.” That kind of perceived victimhood can lead to an ideological group circling its wagons, resulting in deepening defensiveness, hostility, and increasing isolation from the world at large.Cognitive dissonanceNeedless to say, such social dynamics can be unhealthy, and in extreme cases, true believers might even resort to violence to defend their beliefs.1

Beyond Scaling Artificial Intelligence
--- Data ---
Artificial intelligenceis advancing at an unprecedented speed, and this is primarily driven by the dominant paradigm of “scaling”—more computing, more data, and more parameters, i.e., larger models. The allure of scaling lies in its simplicity: if we keep making models bigger, perhaps we'll eventually achieve human-like AI, or ArtificialGeneral Intelligence(AGI)—machines capable of human-level intelligence,creativity, adaptability, and generalization. Yet, as impressive as these large language models are, important theoretical questions remain unanswered. Is scaling alone truly sufficient for achieving genuine understanding, human-like creativity, or, more profoundly, consciousness? In this post, I argue that scaling, despite its practical successes, is fundamentally limited in its ability to produce true AGI. Instead, AI researchers will need insights from contemporary neuroscience. These approaches reveal critical blind spots in our current AI trajectory, challenging the simplistic notion that bigger will always mean better and offering a richer, more integrated path toward genuine intelligence and creativity.Artificial intelligenceGeneral IntelligencecreativityStuart Russell, a top AI researcher at Berkeley, sharply critiques the scaling approach, highlighting the absence of fundamental guiding principles underlying these massive models, often called "giant black boxes." Scaling is an empirical, rather than theoretical, strategy: it lacks a solid scientific basis guaranteeing progress toward AGI. Practical limitations loom—like finite amounts of useful data and physical limits on computing capacity. More troubling, Russell points out that even impressive breakthroughs—such as AlphaGo’s acclaimed successes—can mask underlying misunderstandings, creating illusions of intelligence without genuine comprehension. This raises serious doubts about whether scaling alone could lead to true AGI. If scaling fails to deliver on its promises, we risk not only stagnation but a potentially devastating "AI winter," leaving the field economically and scientifically stranded.Recent research highlights emergent abilities—skills spontaneously arising only after models surpass certain size thresholds—as having a similarity with the human brain. Wei et al., 2022 report that tasks like arithmetic and multi-step reasoning appear abruptly at specific scales, defying simple predictions. These properties initially seem to support scaling strategies: perhaps the path to AGI is simply discovering larger emergent transitions. However, the unpredictability underlines a critical vulnerability: emergent abilities are fundamentally uncertain, appearing without warning and lacking theoretical explanations. Without a deeper understanding of why these transitions happen, we remain unable to predict future breakthroughs reliably. Yann LeCun, Chief AI Officer at Meta, and winner of the Turing Award, makes this point repeatedly. Instead, we depend on trial and error, an inherently risky strategy, in terms of AI safety, for developing something as significant as AGI. Such unpredictability underscores the urgency of grounding AI in robust scientific principles.Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP), a well-supported theoretical framework, describes the brain as an adaptive, nonlinear dynamical system minimizing uncertainty via active inference. Unlike AI’s passivepattern recognition, the embodied brain engages in an action-perception cycle, predicting and controlling sensory inputs. Our brains constantly generate predictions and adjust when reality doesn’t match. Faced with uncertainty, we update beliefs or act to shape outcomes. This offers what scaling “laws” lacks: a guiding principle for adaptive intelligence. Similarly, Scott Kelso’s metastability explains the brain’s flexibility in transitioning between order and disorder. Both theories emphasize embodiedcognition, highlighting the limits of disembodied AI. Cognition arises from dynamic coupling between brain, body, and environment—something today’s AI lacks, restricting real-world understanding. True intelligence emerges through real-time sensorimotor interaction, not static pattern-matching alone.FEPpattern recognitioncognitionAt first glance, AI models like ChatGPT and the human brain share a core similarity: both function as prediction engines. Both rely on patterns to make predictions—LLMs use text-based patterns, while the brain integrates sensory and lived experience patterns. However, the way they generate predictions reveals a profound difference in intelligence itself. Foundation models operate by predicting the next token in a sequence, drawing from massive datasets to determine the most probable response. Currently, they function as sophisticated pattern-matching machines that approximate coherence without meaning—only syntax, not semantics.In contrast, the human brain’s predictive engine works dynamically—constantly generating hypotheses about the world, updating beliefs through sensory experience, and adjusting behavior accordingly. The brain doesn't just predict passively; it acts to shape its environmentin order toreduce uncertainty. This is true agency, a self-correcting loop of action-perception that is absent in today’s AI systems, which remain passive processors of text. This is the distinction between agentic AI, and agency. Without embodiment and an intrinsic drive to minimize uncertainty in real-world interaction, AI remains fundamentally limited—it can predict, but it cannotunderstand.in order tounderstandThe philosopher Luciano Floridi’s wrote a recent paper,AI as Agency Without Intelligence, which reinforces the distinction between LLM-based AI and human cognition. While LLMs display remarkable linguistic fluency and may display a primitive form of agency, they operate as statistical pattern processors, not true intelligence systems. Floridi refines the popular "stochastic parrot" critique, noting that LLMs don’t simply regurgitate text—they synthesize and restructure data in novel, emergent ways, similar to a student stitching together an essay from multiple sources without deep comprehension.AI as Agency Without IntelligenceMorevoer, John Searle’s Chinese Room Experiment argues that AI, like a person following a rulebook to manipulate Chinese symbols without understanding them, only simulates intelligence rather than truly comprehending language. Similarly, AI models process symbols without real meaning or intentionality. This highlights the gap between simulation and genuine understanding, reinforcing that scaling alone won’t create true intelligence without grounding in cognition and real-world experience.AGI doesn’t imply acritical consciousness—a distinction underscored byneuroscientistAnil Seth. Intelligence involves flexible, goal-directed behavior, while consciousness involves subjective experiences and sensations. Contrary to assumptions within the AI community, consciousness isn't merely algorithmic complexity running on the brain’s wetware. Instead, consciousness emerges from being a living, embodied, self-organized organism motivated by self-preservation. This challenges the assumption that consciousness will spontaneously emerge from “simply” increasing intelligence. Even if AI were to reach human-level intelligence, consciousness might remain elusive unless explicitly accounted for. The distinction between intelligence and consciousness further emphasizes the necessity of neuroscience. Understanding consciousness through embodiment may be essential for moving beyond AI toward genuine consciousness.neuroscientistAI Predicts Chemical Makeup From Photos4 Steps to Overcome AI-Induced Imposter SyndromeGiven this, we can still bridge these neuroscience insights with practical agentic AI. Recent neuroscience research from Kotler et al., 2025, highlights how flow states— optimal conditions ofpeak performanceand effortless creativity—integrate System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative, controlled) cognition, enabling adaptivedecision-making. Today’s AI almost mimics both—LLMs excel at quick pattern-based recognition (System 1), while inference-time computation enables multi-step reasoning (System 2). However, AI lacks embodied, dynamic interplay between these processes.peak performancedecision-makingAgentic AI, guided by neuroscience, could partner with humans, enhancing creativity,intuition, and performance. Future agentic AI must align with human cognition, supporting flow states, enabling true human-AI synergy through active inference, and embodied intelligence. By grounding these agentic systems in neuroscience-derived principles, we transform AI from passive computational tools into true creative partners (and keep in mind, even the brain is a black box!). Ultimately, this synthesis promises transformative advancements, enabling AI to augment rather than merely replicate human intelligence. Moving forward, embracing neuroscience in AI development is essential for responsibly navigating the pathway toward genuinely intelligent—and perhaps consciously aware—machines.intuition

If Preschool Isn't Prep Time, What Should We Do Now?
--- Data ---
The popularity of my recentPsychology Todayblog post (Preschool Isn't Prep—It's Prime Time for Brain Growth) underscored something powerful: a growing wave of parents and educators are rethinking the purpose of preschool. For too long, “prep time” has been the driving narrative—preschool as the launchpad for academic achievement, measured in ABCs, phonics drills, and math workbooks. But what happens when we step back and ask: Is this best for our children? And if not, what should we be doing instead?Psychology TodayLet’s start by understanding that systemic change takes time. Public policies, school systems, and national curriculum standards do not change overnight. However, our individual choices—what we do with our preschoolers each day, the environments we create, and the programs we select—can change immediately. These choices carry significant importance.Research shows that preschool is critical not because it’s a miniature version of elementary school but because it provides a foundation for lifelong learning, social development, andemotional regulation. The benefits are profound when high-quality early childhoodeducationfocuses on whole-child development. For instance, Pianta, Barnett, and Burchinal emphasized that adequate preschool settings are those rich in play, communication, and adult-child interaction—not drill-and-kill prep sessions for kindergarten tests (Pianta et al., 2009).emotional regulationeducationchild developmentPianta et al.So, what can we do now if “prep time” isn't the point? Here are five research-backed curricula, programs, and activities that are developmentally sound, emotionally rich, and immediately actionable.One powerful alternative is the Jumpstart Program, which integrates literacy, social-emotional development, and relationship-based learning. It emphasizes meaningful connections between adult mentors and children, particularly those from underserved backgrounds. The program enhances early literacy and fosters children’s agency and socialconfidence, offering a holistic approach rather than a narrow academic one (Yen & Lee, 2019).confidenceYen & Lee, 2019Another example is thephilosophyof Eager to Learn, a comprehensive framework for preschool education developed by the National Research Council. This approach emphasizes inquiry, curiosity, guided play, and emotional safety. Children thrive when they are given the time and tools to explore the world in their own unique way through stories, outdoor discovery, and imaginative play (Burns et al.).philosophyBurns et al.Though not always cited in U.S. public policy, the Reggio Emilia approach (Edwards, C., Gandini, L., & Forman, G.,2012). continues to gain popularity for good reason. This philosophy, grounded in respect for children as capable and curious learners, centers on art,collaboration, and project-based learning. Parents can adopt aspects of this at home simply by offering open-ended materials—clay, fabric, loose parts—and encouraging storytelling, reflection, and documentation of children’s thoughts.collaborationIn rural settings, programs such as the Preschool in Mozambique intervention have shown that even modest early education efforts focused on parent engagement and culturally relevant play can significantly enhance developmental outcomes. Importantly, these improvements are not linked to academic preparation but to offering a responsive, relational early learning experience (Martinez et al.).Martinez et al.Why Education Is ImportantTake our ADHD TestFind a Child TherapistFinally, there’s the “Getting Ahead” framework, which reframes enrichment not as extra tutoring but as intentional time spent in activities like music, dance, nature exploration, and storytelling. These experiences stimulatecreativity,executive function, andself-regulationfar more than rote memorization ever could (Smyth, 2016).creativityexecutive functionself-regulationSmyth, 2016For parents and educators looking for accessible, screen-based, and real-world tools that support these philosophies, here are a few widely available options that align with whole-child learning:PBS Kids programmingDaniel Tiger’s NeighborhoodMister Rogers’ NeighborhoodElinor Wonders Whyemotional intelligenceSesame StreetfriendshipStoryline OnlineimaginationGoNoodleNature scavenger huntsmemoryWhen School Feels Like HomePreschool Isn't Prep—It's Prime Time for Brain GrowthThese are not just entertainment. When used thoughtfully—especially when adults watch and play alongside children—they reinforce what research shows: young children need safe, responsive environments to feel, move, play, listen, and connect. Co-viewing and participating creates powerful opportunities for conversation, emotional learning, and shared joy, transforming passivescreen timeinto active, relationship-rich learning. While educational reform navigates policy cycles and legislative debates, we are not powerless as caregivers and educators. We are the primary architects of our children’s learning lives. Let’s ask better questions: Is my child learning to express emotions? Can they engage deeply with a story? Do they feel safe exploring new materials or ideas? These are the roots ofresilienceand creativity. They are not found in flashcards but in conversations, playrooms, and backyards.screen timeresilienceAs the buzz around school readiness continues, we must remember that preparing children for life is not the same as preparing them for school. Let’s raise preschoolers not to ace a test but to love learning, care for others, and think creatively. That future begins at home, and it starts now.

The "Joy-Pain" of Autism Parenting
--- Data ---
There’s nothing wrong,I kept telling myself.He’s happy.He’s with Josie, he’s fine.Tears filled my eyes and I almost pulled the car over. But I kept going, talking to myself as I drove home, out of the maze that is Boston. I had just dropped off myautisticson Nat at his group home, where he’s lived and thrived for six years. It's a place that always feels sunny to me and smells like laundry and dinner — a big old overheated Victorian home with four housemates—similarly disabled—who make me laugh and give me reports about my son, who rarely speaks.There’s nothing wrong,He’s happyHe’s with Josie, he’s fine.autisticBut on this particular Sunday, I think I went back in time. Back to the emotional stew of the early days with Nat, my beautiful firstborn son. Back when he was born, in 1989, with huge blue eyes like a Disney bunny. I lost myself in those eyes, trying to grasp what was going on, trying to understand why he seemed vulnerable like he could die at any moment. And yet he was such a healthy boy, who pushed up from my lap on strong fat little legs, trying to stand, way before babies do. It was wonderful and terrifying. Everything about him was like that. No matter what anyone told me, no matter how many times I told myselfThere’s nothing wrong,it felt so much like there was.There’s nothing wrong,The early years before Nat was diagnosed felt like I was split into two people. There was the me that enjoyed my little son, and I felt proud of his beauty and how smart he was. I took him everywhere, on long walks, where I would talk to him about everything that came into my head while he snoozed in his stroller.And there was also the me that could not enjoy anything with a full heart because I was always—worried? Scared? Confused? I still don’t know exactly what that feeling was.But as I left his home the other day, and drove through Boston in tears, I think I understood a little more. It was pain but there was something else: a sweetness, but dark. Almost chocolatey. Astonished, I realized that the pain had undertones of pleasure. Instantly I felt ashamed.You’re actually enjoying your pain? Are you crazy?You’re actually enjoying your pain? Are you crazy?Yeah, there was no getting around it. This was what I was feeling, and this is what I used to feel with Nat, even before I knew anything.A deep and delicious and crushing joy-pain. There should be a word for the feeling; I’m pretty sure most mothers feel it.We feel joy-pain because of our children’s vulnerability. Even when they’re strong and grown up, we know that we are just not enough. We can’t keep them safe and happy at all times. And for some of our children, we humans really fall short. Nat will never be fully independent. He will always rely on others to look out for him. He can’t tell you when he’s hurt or sick, sad or happy. He doesn’t have a “social” smile. He grins to himself, at his own inner jokes and observations, and he rarely shares what they are. When I ask himWhat’s so funny?He usually says “No.” He wants his feelings, his experiences, totally for himself.What’s so funny?Ironically, that’s why I write about him. I want to know. I want to understand so badly. I want to know if he’s happy.So when I got home, I texted Josie and told her that I was afraid he wasn’t happy. I told her that I still carry around thisfearfor him, even when I know I have someone like her to look after him. I worried that I was being unprofessional by being so open with her, and yet I had to talk to someone about how I was feeling, someone who might get it.fearShe wrote back, “He might not say so much but he is capable of answering for himself and how he feels. Like when he’s upset I’ll ask him ‘Nat, what’s wrong?’ and he will tell me ‘Laundry,’ which means he didn’t get to do his laundry.” Then she added, “He’s a great guy, he melts my heart.”And then I knew I was going to be okay, because of that heart-melting. The feeling she described was a lot like joy-pain. She had become that attached to him, that knowledgable about him.What Is Autism?Take our Autism TestFind a therapist to help with autismThen she added, “He’s in good hands and we will always give him a voice here!” Now I was crying but just fromhappiness. I relaxed, I breathed. Not only was I not sad; I was happy—for him as well as for me. He has someone else in this world who gets him, and who cares deeply for him. Who sees him as a competent man—a great guy— whom she can understand—maybe even more than I do. And so right now, at this moment in time, there is nothing wrong.happiness

The Psychology of Leadership
--- Data ---
Effective leadershipisn’t just about skills or expertise — it’s about mindset, behavior, and the ability to inspire others. Leaders shape workplace culture through their actions, communication, and emotionalintelligence, makingleadershipdevelopment a crucial investment for any organization.Effective leadershipintelligenceleadershipWhen leadership development focuses solely on technical skills and industry knowledge, organizations risk cultivating managers rather than true leaders. Without an emphasis on emotional intelligence, cognitive awareness, and behavioral adaptability, leaders may struggle to inspire teams, navigate workplace challenges, or foster a culture of accountability. This distinction is crucial because while managers may effectively oversee tasks and processes, leaders must inspire, guide, and motivate their teams, promotingcollaboration,innovation, and long-term growth.Research highlightsthat ineffective leadership contributes to higher employee turnover, lower engagement, and increased workplacestress— factors that can significantly impact an organization’s success.collaborationinnovationResearch highlightsstressTo build high-impact leaders, organizations must integrate core psychological principles into their leadership development programs. Here are four foundational principles that drive effective leadership, workplace well-being, and long-term success.Leaders don’t just manage teams—they serve as cultural architects within their organizations, with their behaviors shaping norms, values, and engagement. Employees mirror leadership behaviors, making cultural modeling essential in leadership development.Studiesshow that leadership behaviors directly impact organizational engagement andproductivity. Leaders who prioritize collaboration, accountability, and psychological safety foster innovation and trust, while those who focus solely on personal success risk creating a competitive rather than cohesive work environment. More specifically, aGotara industry reportfound that many technical managers emphasize visibility over team success, unintentionally creating disengagement: “This dynamic can create a culture where managers are more focused on their visibility than on supporting the success of their teams, which can negatively affect overall team performance and morale.” To prevent this, organizations should emphasize modeling and reinforcing the values that drive long-term, collective success.StudiesproductivityGotara industry reportEmotional intelligence(EQ) — the ability to understand and manage your emotions, as well as the emotions of others — deserves its due when developing new leaders.Researchsuggests that EQ is twice as predictive of leadership success as IQ and accounts for up to 90% of the competencies that separate top-performing leaders. Leaders with high emotional intelligence foster collaboration, strengthen team cohesion, and navigate workplace challenges with greater ease.Emotional intelligenceResearchEQ consists of four key components: self-awareness,self-regulation, social awareness, and relationship management. Self-awareness allows leaders to recognize their emotions and understand their impact on behavior, while self-regulation helps them manage their responses under pressure. Social awareness enhances a leader’s ability to empathize and understand the needs of others, and relationship management strengthens communication and conflict resolution skills.self-regulationStudies showthat organizations led byemotionally intelligentleaders experience lower turnover, increased engagement, and stronger team performance. Conversely, leaders with low emotional intelligence struggle with conflict resolution, miscommunication, and employee disengagement.Studies showemotionally intelligentLeaders, like everyone, are influenced bycognitive biases— mental shortcuts that shapedecision-making. These biases can impact judgment, problem-solving, and team dynamics if left unchecked.cognitive biasesdecision-makingCommon leadership biases includeconfirmation bias(seeking information that supports existing beliefs) and status quobias(resisting change even when better alternatives exist).Researchsuggests that leaders who actively challenge their biases by seeking diverse perspectives make more informed and balanced decisions. Encouraging structured decision-making and diverse input helps mitigate these biases and improve leadership effectiveness.confirmation biasbiasResearchOne-size-fits-all leadership training is ineffective in today’s complex business environments. Leadership development must be tailored to the unique strengths and challenges of each individual, ensuring they receive targeted support to maximize their potential.A 2023Gotara reporthighlights that customized leadership development enhances skill acquisition, engagement, and long-term success.Expertsstate that employees who feel supported in their growth report higher job satisfaction and stronger organizational commitment. Without personalized training, organizations risk disengagement, skill stagnation, and lower leadership retention. Tailored leadership development fostersresilience, adaptability, and sustained high performance in an ever-evolving workplace.​Gotara reportExpertsresilienceTo develop leaders who inspire, engage, and drive success, organizations must move beyond traditional training methods and integrate strategies that foster long-termbehavioral change.

When Ethics Hurt: How Rigid Rules Are Failing the Vulnerable
--- Data ---
I recently shared with some of my fellow therapists that I was thinking about coming in to work pro-bono on the weekends to treat low-income clients. To my shock, they all told me that would be unethical.My fellow therapists stated these clients would feel “less than” by being relegated to an “undesirable” timeslot and not enjoying the same benefits and options as other clients who can pay.I countered that I once worked at a drug andalcoholrehab center at which a dentist donated hundreds of thousands of dollars in free dental care to the patients if they came to see him on the weekend, outside of his normal hours. I asked my fellow therapists if this was unethical and to my chagrin, they replied it was. So extreme was their commitment to equality that they felt it would be better for the dentist not to treat these patients at all—even to leave them in chronic physical pain— rather than to exclude them from being seen during the week with the rest of his patients.alcoholAs a person who grew up on government assistance with a single mother with disabilities, I know what it means for people to financially struggle and to experience sub-par healthcare systems. I remember for example accompanying my mom to a Medicaid appointment and being surprised at the low quality of care she received in comparison to me (she prioritized me over herself and made sure I had private insurance). It would have meant the world to my mother if a private practice provider said, “Although it may not be perfect, I can give you much better care than this if you’re able to come see me this weekend.” I know many people who receive care through Medicaid or the VA who would agree.History has taught us that ignoring the self-determination of autonomous human beings leads to injustice. A more powerful group deciding what is supposedly in the best interests of vulnerable people over their objections has never worked out. Ifearthat has become the case in healthcare, where the wishes of a client can be so easily superseded by the consensus of a more powerful group of people.fearI think one fundamental flaw in the current landscape of healthcare ethics is that “equality” is being confused with “equity.” The stark reality is that healthcare is unequal. Life is unequal. If we ignore that reality, we refer low-income clients elsewhere and still feel a sense of self-satisfaction about how equally we treat our privileged clients who remain. But this creates a two-tier healthcare system and makes those inequalities worse. Treating clients as autonomous, unique individuals demands that we abandon one-size-fits all policies and sometimes accept a little inequality in order to bring about equity.While I want to be clear that I will continue to follow legal and ethical guidelines unless and until they are properly emended, I think justice demands that some of these rigid rules need to be reviewed and changed. For example, it’s widely known that medical insurance companies pay therapists rates that are far below market, often less than half of the therapist’s customary charge. Maybe a therapist would be willing to accept medical insurance and that reduced rate in order to provide treatment to low- and middle-income clients.But here’s the trap of equality vs. equity again: if a therapist accepts medical insurance and its vastly reduced rates, they must do so for all of their clients, including the wealthy ones. As a result, many therapists simply don’t accept medical insurance at all. I wonder how much more mental health service would be provided to the public if therapists were free to accept these reduced medical insurance rates from lower income clients but charge their full rate to those able to afford it.This rigidity applies to many aspects oftherapy(and healthcare in general) beyond just financial considerations. For example, can therapists say with certainty that in every single imaginable case, a legally mandated report prompting police intervention in a family is always in the interest of a child? Maybe therapists need to have some latitude to exercise their professional judgement and treat clients as individuals instead of defining them by their circumstances.therapyWhen modern democracy was being formed, political scientists coined the phrase, “tyranny of the majority.” I wonder if many systems of professional ethics are just this tyranny cloaked in the guise of concern. In ethical discussions, when I hear vague and judgmental words like, “professional” and “appropriate” they seem more like a mechanism for the speaker’s biases to be legitimized than for the implementation of some objective noble value. This is, of course,unconsciousas many therapists simply take for granted that their ideas of these terms are the correct ones. But it is tyranny nonetheless.unconsciousMoralityDaredevil, Born Again: Making the Case for Virtue EthicsMilgram's Obedience to Authority Experiment Comes HomeAt the same time, laissez-faire healthcare without any accountability would be equally destructive. I wonder then, can we create systems of ethics that balance flexibility with standards? I think there are examples in history. For example, in the common law system of our courts, judges are often called upon to decide questions of law. This differs greatly from how courts function in much of continental Europe, for example, where Roman and Napoleonic influences have led to courts simply applying existing legal statutes to cases.Perhaps socioeconomic and cultural humility, equity, and justice itself demand the end to professional ethics as we know them. It could simply be that strict codes of ethics may be inherently unethical if individuality and personhood are to be taken into account.

Why Purpose Is the Opposite of Productivity
--- Data ---
We live in a world obsessed withproductivity. From the moment we enter the workforce—often even before—we are taught that what matters most is the end result. The product. The goal. The deliverable.productivityImagine you’re a software developer. Your job is to write code and build applications. In most cases, the process of coding—thecreativity, problem-solving, and learning that happens along the way—is overshadowed by the urgency of getting the final product shipped. Deadlines loom, efficiency is prized, and success is measured in completed tasks.creativityThis is how we are conditioned to operate in nearly every facet of life. The mantra is clear: The ends justify the means.But when we talk about purpose—especially the kind that leads tohappiness, health, and longevity—this model breaks down. Purpose, particularly what I calllittle p purpose(a process-oriented way of living), is theoppositeof productivity as we define it today.happinesslittle p purposeoppositeWhen we pursuelittle p purpose, we aren’t chasing an outcome. We aren’t measuring success by how much we produce or how quickly we accomplish a goal. Instead, we are focused on doing things that light us up—activities that feel meaningful simply because we enjoy them.little p purposeFor example, I love podcasting. I don’t obsess over the number of downloads I get or whether each episode goes viral. Sure, it’s nice when people listen, but that’s not why I do it. I do it because I genuinely love the process. The conversations, the storytelling, the connection—it all energizes me.This is the essence oflittle p purpose. It’s about engaging in activities that bring fulfillment in the moment, rather than striving for some external benchmark of success.little p purposeContrast this with how most of us have been taught to approach life. At work, we chase promotions and productivity metrics. In our personal lives, we strive to build wealth, hit fitnessgoals, or check off societal milestones likemarriageor homeownership. Everything is about the end result.goalsmarriageAnd yet, when we finally reach those milestones, what happens? Often, we’re left feeling empty. The satisfaction is fleeting, and soon we find ourselves asking:What’s next?What’s next?A goal-oriented mindset can be useful in many areas of life—especially in work. But when it comes to purpose, it can backfire in several ways:1. It CreatesAnxietyAnxietyBig, audacious goals often feel overwhelming. If you define your purpose as achieving something monumental—writing a bestseller, becoming a CEO, making millions—you constantly live infearof failure. And even if you reach your goal, the pressure only intensifies:What if I can’t maintain this? What if I fall behind?fearWhat if I can’t maintain this? What if I fall behind?2. It Leads to a Never-Ending ChaseOnce we achieve a goal, the satisfaction is usually short-lived. Rather than basking in fulfillment, we immediately set our sights on something bigger. This cycle keeps us stuck in a "what’s next?"mindset, always chasing the next accomplishment rather than enjoying the present moment.what’s next?"3. It Fuels Comparison and Self-DoubtWhen we measure success by external achievements, we inevitably compare ourselves to others.They have more money. They have a better job. They’ve reached milestones I haven’t.This comparison-driven thinking shifts our focus away from what actually brings us joy and toward arbitrary benchmarks of success.They have more money. They have a better job. They’ve reached milestones I haven’t.If you’ve spent your whole life thinking in terms of outcomes and goals, shifting to a process-oriented mindset can feel uncomfortable at first. But it’s worth it. Here’s how you can start:1. Let Go of Goals (At Least Sometimes)Not everything needs to have a measurable outcome. Engage in activities simply because they bring you joy—whether it’s painting, writing, hiking, or learning a new skill. Allow yourself to do things without attaching a performance metric to them.Does Money Really Make Us Happier?The Hidden Key to Happiness: Purpose-Driven Communities2. Focus on What You EnjoyIf an activity energizes you, that’s reason enough to do it. Forget whether it leads to a promotion, financial gain, or external recognition. Prioritize what makes you feel alive in the moment.3. Stop Comparing Yourself to OthersComparison is one of the biggest traps of a product-focused mindset. When you stop measuring your worth against someone else’s achievements, you free yourself to pursue what genuinely matters toyou.youFor most of our lives, we are trained to be as productive as possible—to accomplish, achieve, and optimize every aspect of our existence. But purpose doesn’t work that way.When we shift from product-focused thinking to process-focused living, we open the door to greater happiness and fulfillment. Instead of chasing an elusive finish line, we learn to appreciate the journey itself.So the next time you feel pressure to “be productive” in your pursuit of purpose, take a step back. Let go of the outcome, embrace the process, and remember: The means justify the ends—not the other way around.

Stress Is Not a Bad Word
--- Data ---
Research suggests that our mindsets about stress—the beliefs we hold about whether stress is harmful or potentially helpful—dramatically influence how stress affects us physiologically, cognitively, and emotionally.Stress will always be part of high-performance athletics, and we wouldn’t want it otherwise, because stress plays a key role in preparing us to perform and in our actual performance. To support a high-performance mindset with regard to stress, it can be helpful to have a nuanced understanding of your autonomicnervous system—of the physiology of how your body actually responds to stress.nervous systemLet's explore what's actually happening in your body during stress. At the center of your stress response is the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Autonomic means self-regulating—in other words, we don’t have to think about the functions of our autonomic nervous system (for example, our circulation, our digestion, our heart rate) for our body to do what it needs to do for us to survive. So our ANS operates essential bodily functions without the need for our conscious awareness. (Though we can bring conscious awareness to them, and that can be impactful.)The ANS has traditionally been divided into two branches:The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is often characterized as your "fight-or-flight" system, and it mobilizes your body's resources to meet challenges. Appropriate sympathetic activation is essential for sport performance. When activated, it:The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)—often known as the "rest-and-digest" system—promotes restoration and recovery. When activated, it:More recent research, particularly Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory, has refined this understanding by distinguishing between different types of parasympathetic responses, highlighting the important role of social engagement in our stress regulation and also the impact oftraumaon structures and functions of our nervous system. (More on this here.)traumaMore on this hereStanford health psychologist Kelly McGonigal has conducted groundbreaking research on how our beliefs about stress influence our biological responses. Her work, along with that of Alia Crum at Stanford and Jeremy Jamieson at Rochester, has revealed something remarkable: When people view stress as potentially enhancing rather than debilitating, their physiological response changes in meaningful ways.In their studies, participants who adopted a "stress-is-enhancing" mindset showed:awehormonesmemorystressfulWhat Is Stress?Take our Burnout TestFind a therapist to overcome stressWhat makes these findings revolutionary is that they challenge the conventionalwisdomthat stress is universally harmful. Instead, they suggest that our interpretation of what stress means—our mindset—plays a crucial role in determining its effects.wisdomYour mindset about stress is not just an abstract thought—it directly influences how your autonomic nervous system responds to challenges. Here's how:When your nervous system interprets a stressor as harmful and overwhelming:decision-makingexecutive functionperception is reality.How Stress May Increase the Risk of StrokeWell-Being: Be Your Own SuperheroWhen you interpret stress as a challenge that you have resources to meet:enlist teammates, coaches, and loved ones to support you in ways that tone your ventral vagal circuitThere are many ways to go about shifting mindsets. Two general categories include top-down (from the brain to the body) and bottom-up (from the body to the brain) approaches. (A third category of mindset intervention support is that of pharmaceutical intervention, which can also be helpful when needed and under the care of a medical professional.) It may be particularly effective to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to build a mindset on stress that enhances your performance.One top-down approach is reframing your stress language. There are messages everywhere around us that stress is bad or something we need to get rid of. You can notice these and remind yourself that your body is providing you with activation to meet a challenge.One bottom-up approach to building a high-performance mindset about stress is to connect with your body and your nervous system. There are many ways to do this—for example, lengthening your exhalation relative to your inhalation (for more,see here) orexploring connections with your vagus nerve. Eighty percent of the information flowing through yourvagus nerveis coming from the body up, and only 20 percent from the brain down. In other words, body-up strategies are powerful, and there are limitless possibilities—you get to decide what works for you.see hereexploring connections with your vagus nervevagus nerveCoregulation is another beautiful way we can support one another in our bodies during stress response. Because we are social animals who do not survive, at least not for years, outside of relationships of care, our autonomic nervous systems are exquisitely tuned to one another. Meaning, whether we think about it or not, we are responding to one another’s levels of activation. So coregulation can be top-down, bottom-up, and biochemistry-shifting all at the same time.There are many, many ways to coregulate, and you (and your teammates and coaches and loved ones) get to explore and find out what works best for you. (For more on that,see here.)see hereDon’t read the importance of mindsets to mean that stress is always unmitigatedly good and that we can handle limitless doses of it. We need recovery. Intentional recovery is a key part of healthy stress responses and optimal performance. You need rest!Mindset matters, and so does discernment with regard to stressors. Chronic stress is different from acute challenges and may require additional resources.Traumatic stress impacts your brain and your nervous systemin ways that are extremely difficult to shift through mindset alone. Trauma has structural and functional impactson your brainand on your nervous system. In other words, our attitude—including our orientation toward stress—is not always a choice.Traumatic stress impacts your brain and your nervous systemon your brainThe takeaway here is that stress doesn’t always need to be reduced, and that if we develop a nuanced understanding of our nervous system, we can use our stress responses as information to support high performance, our bodies, and the well-being and cohesion of our teams.

Why the People You Love Annoy You the Most
--- Data ---
You adore your partner, your best friend, or your family—so why do they sometimes drive you up the wall? Why does Leo’s loud chewing make you want to scream, or why does Maya’s constant need for reassurance drain you?It’s not just you. The closer we are to someone, the more they have the power to irritate us. However, understanding why can help turn those annoyances into moments of connection rather than conflict.As a psychologist, it took me time to truly hear what my clients were saying when they vented about their loved ones. I used to wonder if frustration meant they were questioning the relationship itself. But I’ve learned that being triggered by those we are closest to isn’t a sign that something is wrong—it’s a natural part of being human. The more we care, the more deeply we feel, and sometimes, that includes irritation.At the start of a relationship, we overlook quirks. We might even find them charming. However, over time, as our brains become accustomed to someone’s patterns, those same quirks can become unbearable. It’s like listening to the same song on repeat—eventually, it loses its appeal.Take Javan and Rachel, who have been married for seven years. Javan used to love how Rachel would plan out every little detail of their vacations. Now, he finds it suffocating. “Can’t we just be spontaneous for once?” he groans. Meanwhile, Rachel is irritated that Javan never wants to commit to anything.Address it:Instead of letting irritation build,could you reframe it? Jonah can remind himself that Rachel’s planning is what makes their tripsstress-free. Rachel can appreciate Jonah’s spontaneity as a way to bring balance.Address it:,stressThe things that annoy us in others often highlight something we struggle with ourselves. This is calledprojection—we see in others what we don’t want to face in ourselves.projectionVictoria, aperfectionist, gets irritated when her husband, Sam, procrastinates on household chores. But deep down, she realizes that when she avoids difficult emotions, she procrastinates too—just in different ways. “I hate that I see part of myself in him,” she admits.perfectionistAddress it:The next time someone’s behavior triggers you, ask, 'What part of me is reacting?

Now, whenever his girlfriend, Tasha, suggests an alternative approach, he becomes defensive. He feels criticized, even though Tasha’s intention isn’t to put him down. His reaction is rooted in an old wound, rather than the present moment.Why Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsAddress it:When you feel an over-the-top emotional reaction, pause. Ask yourself:Am I responding to what’s happening now, or am I reacting to something from my past?Address it:Am I responding to what’s happening now, or am I reacting to something from my past?Loving someone doesn’t mean they won’t annoy you—it just means you’re human. But when you understand why certain behaviors trigger you, you can shift from irritation to insight. And that can bring you closer, rather than pushing you apart.

Why Has Audiology Taken a Back Seat in Misophonia Research?
--- Data ---
Asmisophoniaresearch has grown over the past 10 years, the disorder has been studied in the fields of audiology, neuroscience, psychology,psychiatry, and more. This is wonderful news. Yet, how do we integrate findings across these disparate branches of knowledge, especially since each area of study contains different terminology? Psychology and audiology use vastly different language. Psychology (and mental health) terms are more accessible because they are used in everyday language. Most people know whatanxietyis, for example. Audiology terms, on the other hand, are more esoteric. Neuroscience and psychology are also distinct fields, with distinct languages, but they're like long-time colleagues who are used to working together. They are familiar with one another, and researchers in each field know how to find common ground.misophoniapsychiatryanxietyAudiology and mental health, however, are less intertwined, leaving some important lapses in both research and treatment for misophonia. When we speak of “auditory,” this includes what happens in the ear as well as what happens to sound in the brain. What is audiology’s contribution to the understanding of misophonia? What do we know? What needs to be studied? To fill in some of these blanks, I spoke with Dr. Julia Campbell, audiologist, professor, and researcher at The University of Texas at Austin..Jennifer Brout: Dr. Campbell, would you briefly explain how sound travels from the outside world and through the ear, and is then perceived by the brain?Jennifer Brout: Dr. Campbell, would you briefly explain how sound travels from the outside world and through the ear, and is then perceived by the brain?Julia Campbell: Sound waves enter the outer ear through the canal. In response, the eardrum vibrates. Vibrations are picked up by tiny bones in the middle ear, which are called ossicles, which amplify these waves and transmit them to the inner ear, specifically the cochlea [a snail-like structure filled with fluid and tiny hairs]. From the cochlea, electric signals travel to higher parts of the brain where meaning is attached to sound. Sound, like all the sensory information, only finds meaning as it moves through the perceptual process of the brain.JB: So, the peripheral parts of the auditory system (outer ear—auditory nerve) transmit signals to the central auditory system, which includes the brain stem and the brain.JB: So, the peripheral parts of the auditory system (outer ear—auditory nerve) transmit signals to the central auditory system, which includes the brain stem and the brain.JC: Yes.JB: Where in this process are we looking for misophonia?JB: Where in this process are we looking for misophonia?JC: We have been looking in the centralnervous system, mainly in the cortex, which again is where auditory information is interpreted and integrated with other brain areas. Most studies have focused on higher levels of the brain related tocognition,executive functioning, and emotions. However, there has been very little research on all levels of the auditory system, starting at the cochlea, moving through the brainstem, and up through the primary auditory cortex. So far, findings do not indicate any inner ear or auditory brainstem anomalies related to misophonia, but there are some new studies that suggest possible atypicality at the level of the thalamus [a structure deep in the brain that serves as a relay center for sensory and motor signals, regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness] and auditory cortex.nervous systemcognitionexecutive functioningJB: Why is this important?JB: Why is this important?JC: It is important to know if atypicality in the ear or brainstem structures may be impacting the perception of sound at higher levels of the auditory central nervous system. For instance, it could be that a deficit in the inner ear or brainstem causes downstream processing issues related to or resulting in misophonia. Therefore, the cause of the perceptual problem (located in the cortex) is occurring at a lower level, which would affect the intervention approach. This possibility should at least be ruled out before assuming the issue is only occurring in the cortex.JB: You’ve said that you think there may be multiple causes of misophonia.JB: You’ve said that you think there may be multiple causes of misophonia.JC: Yes. Misophonia may result from various causes, but we really don’t know. How do we pinpoint a single cause when the brain is so complicated, and perception involves interaction between basicsensory processing(including visual processing), cognition, and emotions? Because of this, it is possible that we may end up with subtypes of misophonia related to etiology. One thing we do know is that the onset of misophonia typically occurs inchildhood. This points to a possible role of developmental processes that may give rise to these symptoms.sensory processingchildhoodJB: I am glad you mentioned visual processing because we know this is also an issue for people with misophonia, thus the term misokinesia. We always want to find “the answer,” but it is much more complicated. All the senses work together, so the idea that visual stimuli are also triggering does not mean we should stop looking at auditory processing, right?JB: I am glad you mentioned visual processing because we know this is also an issue for people with misophonia, thus the term misokinesia. We always want to find “the answer,” but it is much more complicated. All the senses work together, so the idea that visual stimuli are also triggering does not mean we should stop looking at auditory processing, right?What Is Misophonia?Find a therapist near meJC: Right.JB: Switching up the topic a bit…do you think auditory gating [the brain's ability to suppress responses to repetitive acoustic stimuli] may have anything to do with misophonia?JB: Switching up the topic a bit…do you think auditory gating [the brain's ability to suppress responses to repetitive acoustic stimuli] may have anything to do with misophonia?JC: Gating is a very interesting issue. Auditory gating happens at many different levels of the brain. I look at pre-attentive gating—how the brain modulates incoming stimuli at the nonconscious level—so, again, lower levels of the brain. If auditory gating is impaired, then the higher executive centers are flooded with too much information.JB: Is this likefilteringin central auditory processing disorder (CAPD)?JB: Is this likein central auditory processing disorder (CAPD)?JC: Yes, it is possible that this function is important in CAPD. For instance, a hallmark characteristic of CAPD is that individuals cannot separate speech from background noise, and the result is impairment in the understanding of language, because higher levels of the brain may become overwhelmed with too much auditory information, compromising cognition.Exposure Therapy Is Not Treatment for MisophoniaMisophonia Is Not Just About Sounds: Visual Context MattersJB: This leads me right to my next question. Wouldn’t it help us understand misophonia if we knew if there was co-occurrence with CAPD? Wouldn’t this be easy to do?JB: This leads me right to my next question. Wouldn’t it help us understand misophonia if we knew if there was co-occurrence with CAPD? Wouldn’t this be easy to do?JC: Yes, and yes. It would be easy for audiologists to give a misophonia screener to their CAPD patients—at least we would get an idea about the prevalence of thecomorbidityof these disorders that could be followed up with more rigorous study.comorbidityJB: There is so much more we could talk about but my final question is—what study would you like to see next for misophonia?JB: There is so much more we could talk about but my final question is—what study would you like to see next for misophonia?JC: I would like to see more studies that include auditory EEG measures from the inner ear, through the brainstem, and up through the cortex so that we would have more specific information about the auditory pathway. MRI studies are great, again for the higher brain centers, but we really need to get a more comprehensive picture of the entire pathway.There was a lot more that I could have discussed with Dr. Campbell. Most importantly, I realize that although audiology is so central to misophonia, the research has remained on the periphery. As an individual with misophonia, I would certainly like to see this change.

A Winning Strategy for Improving Group Decision-Making
--- Data ---
We all work in groups sometimes. We brainstorm in groups. Students work on group projects. Even faculty at universities work in committees, and our research projects are generally collaborations. Since we spend so much time and effort working in groups, it would be nice to have a few tools that could easily improve group brainstorming anddecision-making.decision-makingLuckily, there’s an approach that reliably improves group decision-making. It works in laboratory tasks over short time periods. It also helps long-term groups in science and business succeed.This key approach relies on group diversity.When we confront a problem, we start by brainstorming possible solutions. The goal of brainstorming is to generate possible solutions, without evaluating those ideas during the brainstorming session. You want to generate a variety of ideas, you want the ideas to be creative, and you want at least some of the ideas to be high quality. Here are two pieces of advice for improving brainstorming.First, you should start by thinking individually. Later, you can bring the group together to construct a possible set of options. When people start by thinking of their own ideas first, they will generate a greater variety of ideas. If we begin by generating together, we are often limited by the first ideas that people provide. These first ideas tend to block people from coming up with a wider range of possibilities because those are at the forefront of their thoughts (Hyman, Cardwell, & Roy, 2010; Deihl & Strobe, 1987). By brainstorming individually first, groups start with a wider range of suggestions. And hearing that wider variety of ideas may help people generate even more possibilities.In addition to brainstorming individually first, having a more diverse group also leads to a wider set of options and more creative options. The research on the value of having people from diverse cultural backgrounds contributing to group brainstorming goes back at least three decades (McLeod, Lobel, & Cox, 1996). In this work, groups with greater diversity performed better in generating effective ideas than groups that were culturally homogeneous (Flores and colleagues, 2021). More recent work illustrates that creating a context in which the contributions from people from various cultural backgrounds are valued is important for getting that broader set of creative contributions (Camargo and colleagues, 2020).The findings for diversity and brainstorming are clear. More diverse groups result in more and better ideas. Organizations can increase the effectiveness of diverse groups by creating contexts in which the contributions of everyone are valued.Diversity can help collaborative work beyond the idea generation stage. Diverse groups also improve decision-making, potentially by decreasing the likelihood that groups will fall into agroupthinkfailure pattern. In groupthink, people tend to quickly agree on an answer and may fail to consider a variety of options. In some cases, this can lead a group to get stuck because they fail to evaluate the risks and benefits of a variety of options.groupthinkIn a study of how people make decisions related to price bubbles in markets, Levine and colleagues (2014) looked at culturally homogeneous and diverse groups. The task was a game in which people played something like a stock market. If they did well, they could earn real money. In conditions with less diversity, price bubbles were more likely to grow, and crashes were harder. In more diverse groups, with people from different countries, the bubbles were more limited and crashes less severe.How does this play out in real situations? This is harder to assess, but some researchers have looked at group composition in different professional contexts. One set of researchers looked at law firms in terms of diversity (Smulowitz et al., 2019). Law firms with more diversity had greater financial performance than firms with less diversity. In a very different domain, AlShebli and colleagues (2018) looked at the impact of diversity on scientific research. They looked at more than 9 million published academic papers, assessing author diversity in terms ofgenderand ethnic background. They found that when the set of authors was more ethnically diverse, the paper had a greater impact on other researchers (measured as the number of times other researchers cited the paper).genderHaving more diverse groups leads to better brainstorming. More diverse groups are less likely to fall into groupthink and get stuck in ugly financial bubbles. And diversity improves the financial outcomes of groups as well. You can argue that creating contexts that support diversity is important for providing opportunities to a greater variety of people. But even if you ignore thatmotivation, more diverse groups seem to be simply better for ideas and outcomes.motivation

Adolescence, Unfiltered
--- Data ---
As a psychotherapist, I often find myself reflecting on the ways the media portrays mental health,adolescence, and the complexities of family dynamics. The new Netflix seriesAdolescenceoffers a compelling and unnerving look into the mind of a 13-year-old boy named Jamie, who is accused of committing a brutalcrime: the murder of a female classmate. What makes this series so impactful is the tension it builds around one question: Could this sweet, seemingly innocent tween have committed such an atrocity?adolescenceAdolescencecrimeEven after we witness the chilling police video of Jamie stabbing his classmate, the question lingers. The video doesn’t show Jamie’s face, and we are left hoping he didn’t do it. But as the story unravels, we come face-to-face with profound, unsettling truths about modern adolescence—truths that may make us rethink how we understand and respond to young people as parents, caregivers, and therapists.One of the most powerful themes inAdolescenceis the impact of technology on today's youth. Parents of this generation are caught between wanting to provide their children with the best of everything—new phones, gaming systems, and access to endless information—and the reality that these devices can isolate and harm their children. Jamie spends hours, often days, behind closed doors, engaged with technology—whether through his phone, computer, or gaming consoles. He’s disconnected from peers, lacking sleep, exercise, and healthy social interactions.AdolescenceAs parents, we know this pattern all too well, yet we often feel powerless to intervene. We understand the risks: poor sleep, changes inappetiteand mood, and lack of socialization—all indicators of a struggling adolescent. But there’s a disconnect. Parents might be aware that their children are hooked on their devices, yet the idea of pulling the plug feels daunting. The question is: Are we as a society truly prepared to address the role that technology plays in shaping our children's mental health?appetiteThe veil between the virtual world and reality can become so thin that young minds like Jamie's might not register the gravity of their actions. Video games, violent content, and exposure to harmful material may distort a child’s sense of reality, making violent behavior seem not just possible but almost normalized. The lines blur, and for Jamie, committing a violent act might not feel as wrong as it should.Another deeply compelling aspect ofAdolescenceis its exploration ofgenerational trauma. While Jamie’s father does not physically abuse him, as his father abused him, the series raises important questions about how unresolvedtraumapasses from one generation to the next. How did Jamie’s father expressanger? How did he show love? How did he discipline Jamie, and how did he support him during his most vulnerable moments? These questions reveal some of the deeper emotional currents that affect Jamie’s development—and, in turn, his actions.Adolescencegenerational traumatraumaangerThe show illuminates how the way a father—a male role model—handles emotions can profoundly impact a young boy's psychological development. Despite his best intentions, Jamie's father struggles to connect with his son, leaving him to navigate his inner turmoil mainly alone.The role of Jamie's mother in the series is equally significant. Her character often seems pushed to the periphery, highlighting the vital role of fathers and male figures in shaping boys’ lives. The mother’s approach is rooted in the desire to make life comfortable and easy for her son. She wants to shield him from hardship, believing that providing material comfort and an easy life will make him happy and, by extension, a good person.What Changes During Adolescence?Find a therapist to support kids and teensHowever, this approach, though well-intentioned, misses the mark. In one poignant moment, Jamie calls his father to change his plea, and his mother, choking back tears, asks him about his well-being in prison as if he were attending a private school. Her concern for his comfort overrides the more profound, urgent need to understand what is happening in her son’s mind.This reflects a broader societal issue: Many parents, despite their best efforts, miss the signs of emotional distress in their children. There’s a tendency to over-shelter or indulge, which fails to acknowledge the complexities of growing up today.The overarching message ofAdolescenceis clear: Parents must get more involved in their children’s lives, especially their online lives. It’s no longer enough to provide material comforts or assume that children will be fine if they have the latest gadgets.Boundariesmust be set, consequences must be enforced, and perhaps most importantly, parents must be willing to tolerate the discomfort that may come with their children not always being happy.AdolescenceBoundariesManaging Expectations About Adolescent ChangeThe Lonely Teen: Would a Nutritional Metaphor Bring Insight?This doesn’t mean punishing or condemning kids' online behavior but engaging with them—having open, nonjudgmental conversations about what they’re experiencing. What are they watching online? What games are they playing? What’s going on in their virtual worlds? By engaging in meaningful conversations with kids, we can begin to break down the walls that technology often creates and foster deeper emotional connections.Adolescenceis a hard show to watch, but it’s essential. It’s a wake-up call for parents, educators, and mental health professionals. We must confront the reality that today’s youth are facing unprecedented challenges—challenges that we, as a society, have only begun to understand. Watching this show is not just about observing a tragedy unfold; it’s about starting the conversation we all need to have.AdolescenceWatch this show. Watch it with the young people in your life. Ask questions. Listen without judgment. Most importantly, engage with them on a deeper level. There’s no quick fix, but through meaningful dialogue and a commitment to understanding, we can start to make a difference in their lives before it’s too late.

The Consequences of Masking in Autism
--- Data ---
Masking is a strategy that someautisticfolks use to appear non-autistic and be more accepted in society. Researchers are just now beginning to explore masking in autism, so it is hard to say how many individuals mask. However, questionnaires like the CAT-Q can be used to identify and explore camouflaged traits in autism.autisticSome factors increase how likely an autistic person is to mask. For example, women, girls,nonbinarypeople, and people of color report higher masking rates. This is likely due to misconceptions and stereotypes about what autism does or doesn’t “look like.” Also, people who are diagnosed with autism later in life tend to mask more than those diagnosed as children or inadolescence.nonbinaryadolescenceMasking is mentally and physically draining. It’s hard to suppress or hide aspects of who you are and what you need. Chronic masking can lead to poor mental health, lowerself-esteem, autisticburnout, and even suicidal thoughts. So understanding what it is and managing its impact is essential both for autistic folks trying to manage its impact and loved ones who want to offer support.self-esteemburnoutAutistic masking is a term used in the autistic community to describe the conscious orunconscioussuppression of autistic traits to appear more neurotypical and be more accepted by society. It can be seen as an umbrella term for anycamouflaging, compensating, or adaptive morphing behaviors used to fit in. Autistic folks might learn to mask by observing and mimicking others in their lives or characters in books, movies, and TV shows.unconsciouscamouflagingMasking can be used in formal situations like work or school and in informal settings like with family or friends. Although anyone could adapt their behavior to match the expectations of their environment, masking among autistic individuals is an exhausting effort to meet the social and societal demands of a neurotypical world. It can lead to consequences including autistic burnout and mental health struggles such asdepression,anxiety, and eating disorders.depressionanxietyFor folks who weren’t diagnosed with autism until later in life, it is common to have unconsciously masked for many years. When late-diagnosed autistics finally learn of their neurodivergence, they might experienceidentitystruggles or feelings of isolation. Chronic, unconscious masking can leave people confused about who they would have been if they didn’t constantly feel the need to suppress their autistic traits and interests.identitystimmingWhat Is Autism?Take our Autism TestFind a therapist to help with autismJust as every autistic person’s experience with autism is unique, masking can serve many functions. Here are some examples:discriminationattentionpunishmentThe consequences of masking are multifaceted. Autistic folks who can mask acknowledge that it can be seen as a privilege to others in the community who are unable to suppress their autistic traits. There are benefits to masking, which is why the behavior exists in the first place.Disabled and Dutch: Are We Failing Our Disabled Citizens?Will We Discover What Causes Autism?Masking can allow autistic folks to “pass,” leading to increased protection and less discrimination,stigma, orbullying. Masking can result in more acceptance or praise in the workplace or school. It can also help autistic folks build and maintain relationships.stigmabullyingHowever, even after acknowledging the benefits, research has shown that suppressing autistic traits has many negative consequences. When folks consistently suppress who they are and what they need, it takes a toll on the mind and body. Masking can lead to:Suicidalityself-harmChronic paintraumaThe National Autistic Society has compiled feedback from autistic people and the latest research to create strategies for managing the consequences of masking. Some of these strategies include allowing yourself recovery time after social interactions, seeking an autism diagnosis or using self-diagnosing tools, spending time with other autistic people, and beginning to consider and explore who you are without your mask.Some high-masking autistic folks find that it can be helpful to explore their identity and support needs intherapy. Since masking can lead to additional mental health struggles like depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation, having a professional you can talk to and process your experience with may be necessary. Make sure that you ask about their experience with autism and the impact of masking.therapyTo find a therapist, please visit thePsychology Today Therapy Directory.To find a therapist, please visit thePsychology Today Therapy Directory.Psychology Today Therapy Directory.

Unmasking 101: Learning to Be Who You Are
--- Data ---
If you were diagnosed as neurodivergent later in life—autistic,ADHD, or otherwise wired differently—there’s a good chance you’ve spent yearsmasking. You may have learned early on to hide parts of yourself to stay safe, to fit in, or to avoid being punished, bullied, or rejected. Especially if you’re LGBTQIA+, this pressure toconformwas probably compounded by social, cultural, or even internalized expectations about how you were “supposed” to be.autisticADHDmaskingconformUnmasking is the process of undoing that. It’s not about rejecting everything you’ve built—it's about finding out which parts are you, and which parts were survival mechanisms.Masking often starts young. Many late-diagnosed adults describe decades of feeling “off” without the language or validation to understand why. You might have copied others’ behavior, laughed at jokes you didn’t get, or rehearsed entire conversations in advance. Masking isn’t always a conscious choice—it’s atraumaresponse. It’s about safety. For many, it starts early in life as a way to avoidbullying, social rejection, or misunderstandings. It can involve suppressing stimming behaviors, forcing eye contact, mimicking social cues, and hiding special interests. While masking can be a useful tool in certain situations, it can also be incredibly draining and lead toburnout,anxiety, anddepression.traumabullyingburnoutanxietydepressionFor late-diagnosed adults, masking may have become so ingrained that it's hard to know where the mask ends and the authentic self begins. For queer neurodivergent folks, masking may have shown up in bothgenderexpression and neurodivergent traits, creating a complex web ofidentitysuppression. Many of us weren’t just masking—we were performing entire alternate selves.genderidentityA 2017 study by Hull et al. found that autistic adults who masked heavily were more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and burnout. And research continues to show high rates of late or missed diagnoses in AFAB (assigned female at birth) individuals and LGBTQIA+ communities (Strang et al., 2020).Unmasking can lead to a greater sense of self-acceptance, improved mental health, and more fulfilling relationships. When we're constantly masking, we're essentially hiding a part of ourselves, which can lead to feelings of isolation and inauthenticity. Unmasking allows us to connect with others on a deeper level and find communities where we're accepted for who we are.It doesn’t mean “be your rawest self 24/7.” That’s not always safe or realistic. Unmasking is about slowly reconnecting with your real self, without judgment.Unmasking is a personal journey, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach. However, here are some tips to help you get started:1. Identify the Mask1. Identify the MaskStart by noticing situations where you feel disconnected, drained, or hyper-aware of how you’re coming across. Do you laugh when you're uncomfortable? Avoid stimming in public? Downplay your sensory needs or special interests? These are clues.Reflect gently. You’re not wrong for masking. You did what you had to. Now, you’re learning what you get to let go of.2. Create Safer Containers2. Create Safer ContainersUnmasking is easier when you’re not constantly bracing for harm. Seek out people and spaces where neurodivergence is understood—or at least respected. This might mean LGBTQIA+ support groups, neurodivergent peer circles, trauma-informed therapists, or online communities.You don’t have to unmask everywhere. You can choose where to be more open, based on safety and trust.Boundariesare part ofauthenticitytoo.Boundariesauthenticity3. Validate Your Communication Style3. Validate Your Communication StyleMany neurodivergent people communicate directly, passionately, or through movement, writing, or silence. That’s not “wrong”—just different. (I'll explore social-based communication versus object-based communication in another post.) You might info-dump when excited or need time to process before responding. That’s valid.The Strain of Masking: Reclaiming Our Neurodivergent SelvesWhy Neurodivergent Women Struggle With Impostor FeelingsPracticing unmasking might mean saying, “I need a second to think,” or not pretending to follow a conversation that’s lost you. It might mean unapologetically using captions, stim toys, or scripting texts ahead of time.4. Let Stimming andSelf-RegulationHappen4. Let Stimming andSelf-RegulationHappenSelf-RegulationStimming—rocking, hand-flapping, humming,fidgeting—is a natural way neurodivergent people self-regulate. Many of us were taught to hide it. Letting yourself stim (when it’s safe to do so) can be deeply freeing.fidgetingThink of stimming not as a “quirk” but as yournervous systemspeaking up for what it needs.nervous system5. Grieve What You Didn’t Know5. Grieve What You Didn’t KnowUnmasking can bring upgrief—grief for the years spent not knowing, for the missed supports, the misdiagnoses, the self-blame. Give that grief space. It’s not self-pity; it’s healing. Especially for late-diagnosed adults, it’s common to feel both relief andrage.griefrageWorking with a trauma-informed therapist or coach can help you process this in a way that doesn’t retraumatize you.6. Play With Your Identity6. Play With Your IdentityAs you unmask, you might find yourself questioning more than just your neurotype. Gender,sexuality, culture, and even values can feel up for reevaluation. That’s not a crisis—it’s clarity.sexualityYour past coping strategies might have been built to survive in environments that didn’t see you. Now that you’re safer, you get to ask: What do I actually like? What feels good in my body? Who am I when no one’s watching?Give yourself permission to explore.Unmasking is not about abandoning all social skills or being rude to others. It's about finding a balance between being authentic and navigating social situations. It's OK to mask in certain situations if it feels necessary for your safety or well-being.Despite the challenges, unmasking can lead to a more fulfilling and authentic life. It can lead to greater self-acceptance, improved mental health, and more meaningful relationships. When we allow ourselves to be ourselves, we create space for others to do the same.Unmasking isn’t linear. You might slide the mask on in some rooms and off in others. That’s OK. Showing up authentically doesn’t mean showing up completely all the time—it means letting your real self take up more space when it feels right and safe to do so.You don’t owe anyone a performance. You never did.To find a therapist, please visit thePsychology Today Therapy Directory.To find a therapist, please visit thePsychology Today Therapy Directory.Psychology Today Therapy Directory.

Embracing Detachment: The "Let Them" Theory
--- Data ---
In a world that feels increasingly complex and uncontrollable, a revolutionary psychological approach has captivated millions. Known as the "Let Them" theory, this concept, popularized by Mel Robbins in 2024, has since gone viral, amassing over 15 million views. The theory advocates a radical form of detachment from others' actions, urging us to focus on our reactions and internal states rather than trying to control others or the external world. The simplicity of "Let Them" resonates deeply in today's society, yet its psychological underpinnings and practical applications are rich with complexity.At its core, the "Let Them" theory is grounded in the psychologicallocus of controltheory developed by Julian B. Rotter in the 1950s. The locus of control attribution theory distinguishes between external and internal perceptions of control, explaining how individuals see themselves as either influencing or being influenced by their environment. The "Let Them" theory encourages a shift from an external locus of control, where one feels at the mercy of external events or persons, to an internal locus, focusing on personal agency. The “Let Them” theory intersects significantly with Buddhist principles, particularly the concept of non-attachment, which emphasizes letting go of the desire to control outcomes as a path to inner peace. Additionally, it touches on attachment theory in psychology, which shows how those with "anxious attachment" styles may seek control to secure emotional safety. The "Let Them" theory offers a liberating alternative, promoting security through acceptance and detachment, embodying the Toltecwisdomof letting go "with love and withoutfear," aphilosophythat teaches the release of attachment to foster emotional andspiritualfreedom.locus of controlattachmentwisdomfearphilosophyspiritualThe relevance of the "Let Them" theory today can be attributed to the pervasive feeling of uncertainty that characterizes modern life. From global pandemics to natural disasters to fluctuatingpoliticsand economies, the illusion of control is continuously challenged. This theory offers a way to regain peace by relinquishing attempts to control outside forces, aligning well with the increasing focus onmindfulnessand intrapersonal mental health in society.politicsmindfulnessAdopting the "Let Them" approach can yield psychological benefits. It reducesstressandanxietyby diminishing efforts to control the uncontrollable. In relationships, it can decrease conflict and enhance mutual respect by advocating for autonomy andself-regulation. The focus is on self-improvement and personal choice to promote healthier, more balanced relationships.stressanxietyself-regulationWhat happens when you embrace “Let Them” on a psychological level? First, you immediately reduce the internal conflict that comes from resisting reality. Instead of ruminating on “This shouldn’t be happening,” you ask, “This is happening, now what?” or “How can I best respond to this reality?” This mental shift quiets the stress response. Intherapy, this is known as “radical acceptance,” a distress tolerance skill. Acceptance-based treatment approaches (like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT) can significantly decrease psychological stress and anxiety.therapyIn addition, allowing others autonomy can improve relationship dynamics, reduce defensiveness, and enhance mutual respect. Consciously dropping attempts to control others may further improve relationship dynamics by creating space for voluntary, self-directed change. Most individuals appreciate feeling trusted and respected in relationships. This paradigm shift reduces feelings of being pushed, trapped, and resentful. When individuals feel supported and empowered to make age-appropriate decisions, they feel closer and often more open.The absence of pressure lowers defensiveness, but it does not mean you approve of everything others do. It just means you’re not pressuring them to do what you want. Research onmotivationconfirms that when a person’s autonomy is supported (rather than threatened), they often become more open to influence, not less.motivationWhy Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsIn Robbins' book (2024), she emphasizes how “Let Them” shifts the focus back onto the one thing you can control: yourself. Robbins suggests that after saying “let them,” you then say, “let me,” meaning let me decide what I will do next, given the present reality​.It is important to caution that the simplicity of the "Let Them" theory can be misleading. Detachment does not mean abdication of responsibility or avoidance of engagement. Misinterpretation can lead to passive-aggressiveness, emotional disengagement, and, in some cases, enabling harmful behaviors. "Let Them" cannot function as a blanket solution for all interpersonal issues. This should not be used to avoid conflict or prevent important conversations, strategy sessions, and processing of issues. I caution using this as a mantra to bypass unresolved emotional issues within any significant relationship.When Sameness Betrays FairnessWhy Do We Hold on to Old Flames?To effectively implement the "Let Them" theory, it is crucial to approach it with mindfulness and discernment. Understanding when detachment serves personal and relational health and when it might lead to avoidance or neglect is essential. Communication, including expressing feelings and expectations, can prevent misunderstandings and foster deeper connections. A balanced approach involves respecting both one'sboundariesand those of others, promoting interdependence rather than indifference. Below is a practical three-step framework to apply this theory mindfully:boundaries1. Let Them (Pause and Accept):When triggered by someone’s behavior, pause and accept the reality without trying to change it immediately. Use breathwork to help calm thenervous systemand provide space for rational responses.1. Let Them (Pause and Accept):nervous system2. Let Yourself (Assess and Align):Reflect on your feelings about the situation and align your response with your values and needs. Ask self-inquiry questions to better understand the deeper root of your reactions and the available responses. Differentiate yourself-worthfrom others' actions and clarify your needs without trying to control the outcome.2. Let Yourself (Assess and Align):self-worth3. Take Action (Respond Intentionally):Decide on a purposeful response that aligns with your well-being, whether it’s setting a boundary, communicating your feelings, or choosing to let go. The "Let Them" theory is not just a method of dealing with others; it is a profound way to engage with life itself, accepting the uncontrollable and focusing on our capacity forresilienceand more measured responses.3. Take Action (Respond Intentionally):resilience

Cognitive Biases and Bad Decisions

This is the second post in a series on cognitive biases.This is the second post in a series on cognitive biases.A cognitivebiasis a mental shortcut or heuristic intended to spare us time, effort, or discomfort—often while reinforcing ourself-imageor worldview—but at the cost of accuracy and reliability.biasself-imageFor example, in explaining the behaviour of others, we tend to overestimate the role of character traits over situational factors—a bias, calledfundamental attribution error(FAE), which goes into reverse when it comes to explaining our own behaviour. Thus, if George fails to mow the lawn, I indict him with forgetfulness, laziness, or spite; but if I fail to mow the lawn, I am likely to absolve myself on the grounds of busyness, tiredness, or inclement weather.fundamental attribution errorWell over a hundred cognitive biases have been identified. After studying them, I found that most fitted into one of just eight groups, clusters, or themes:attentionattachmentconformityIn this post, the second in a series on cognitive biases, I’m going to look at the second group: what I have called errors of attention.If you missed my first post, on errors of salience, you canfind it here.find it hereRemember that there can be a lot of overlap between named biases. Instead of trying to distinguish them, focus instead on the principles at play.Our ability to concentrate and pay attention is very limited. For any encounter or interaction, the first few seconds make the greatest impression on us (primacy effect). The last few seconds make the second greatest impression (recency effect). If, as they say, "first impressions count," last impressions count almost as much. What happens in between is a lot easier to forget.Effective speakers, presenters, and interviewees know how to take advantage of cognitive biases such as the primacy and recency effects, and put the greatest effort into their opening and closing performances. Similarly, if airing an opinion in a meeting, it is best to go either first or last.Our ability to concentrate and pay attention varies according to physiological factors such as sleep and blood sugar, and psychological factors such as mood andmotivation. When making successive decisions, our judgement becomes poorer and poorer (decision fatigue). When playing online chess, I will often win the first few games, and then start losing.motivationI usually write best after breakfast. After a few hours, my mind disperses, and I go for a walk to refocus. I find that alternating between mental work and physical work, like gardening, increases my overallproductivity(andhappiness). When working on a difficult book, I will minimise the decisions that I need to make, for example, by wearing the same outfit (if not necessarily the same clothes) every day.productivityhappinessYou can use decision fatigue to your advantage. Shops do that when they position impulse buys next to the till, and restaurants could help themselves and everyone by having more restricted menus. Owing to decision fatigue, people become more risk-averse with successive decisions. So if you are after a bold decision, try to arrange it so that your case gets looked at first thing in the morning, or right after lunch.We are more likely to remember something if it is repeated to us. But even when we do remember something, we soon forget its source (sleeper effect).By repeating it often enough, advertisers and propagandists can be sure that their core message will be remembered long after any misgivings about their source have been forgotten.As Simple as M&M: Teaching Kids About Racism Through PlayThe Emotional Side of Stereotypes in Virtual RealityIn my next post, I will be looking at errors of association.Neel Burton is author ofHypersanity: Thinking Beyond Thinking.Neel Burton is author ofHypersanity: Thinking Beyond ThinkingHypersanity: Thinking Beyond Thinking.

The Human Costs of Unemployment
--- Data ---
Unemployment is always a major factor in any labor market. The often-cited unemployment rate represents people who are not currently employed and have been looking for a job for the past 30 days. The current (March 20, 2025) unemploymentrate is 4.1 %, representing 7.1 million people. A different figure to consider is the percentage of adults who are not employed, which can include students, retired individuals, homemakers, or people no longer looking for a job. This is thelabor force participation rate, which is 62.4 %. In other words, 37.6% of adults are not currently working. The highest unemployment rate inUS history was 24.9% in 1933.Since 1948, the average unemployment rate has been 5.6%. If we look at these figures, it is clear that being unemployed is not an unusual experience. Unemployment for most people who are looking for jobs is seldom a permanent condition.

How to Overcome Overthinking and Spark Breakthrough Ideas
--- Data ---
Do you ever feel like you're overthinking an idea to death? You're not alone. In some ways, your brain might be working against you. A recent study suggests that turning down a particular brain region might beonekey to unlocking breakthrough ideas. So, how do we disrupt those overthinking patterns?oneLet’s take a look at that. If you’re in the throes of reimagining yourcareeror reinventing yourself, today’s topic could speak to you as well.careerAlmost every day feels like an experiment to me. I don’t weigh my days in terms of success or failure like a scientist might. Instead, I move forward, amidst the flux, with micro-experiments infused with curiosity, play, focus, and surprise.I do this, in part, to counter two tendencies:If I’m notmindfuland experimental, this combo leads to overthinking too many ideas at once—which results in idea paralysis. Specifically, self-doubt and uncertainty override creative progress or else an unhealthyboredomand avoidance behavior settles in. When this happens, when I become overwhelmed with ideas, opportunities, or just the constant flux of work and life and the world, I step back into an experimenter’s mindset.mindfulboredomWe recently surveyed numerous entrepreneurs in one of our assessments at Tracking Wonder. Many of them say they’re driven by purpose, impact, and financial return. Yet, they also confess,“I have lots of ideas but haven’t moved forward on any of them.”Sound familiar?“I have lots of ideas but haven’t moved forward on any of them.”Here’s what scientists observed in a new study: If you feel trapped in analysis paralysis, your brain’s right frontal pole might be overstimulated. The right frontal pole is involved in high-levelexecutive functionssuch as self-reflection, mental simulation, and controlleddecision-making.executive functionsdecision-makingThis is all helpful for structured problem-solving, but too much stimulation here can also lead to overthinking, self-censorship, and inhibition of unconventional ideas—you know, the seeds ofcreativityand innovative insight.creativityIn other words, the very part of your brain that helps you analyze ideas might also be shutting down your ability to notice your boldest, most innovative ones. It’s like having two friends at your table: One—the loud one—is all analysis and spreadsheets, beckoning you to the computer. The other—the wondrous one—is all exploration and possibility, calling you outside.Both are part of your creativeintelligence. So the practice of tracking wonder here is about experimenting with when and how to call upon each. It’s also about literally “befriending” both ways of thinking as part of your process.intelligenceThis research affirms what many fulfilled innovators already know: Breakthrough ideas often emerge when we loosen our grip on rigid control. That’s why experiments like freewriting,mind-wandering, curiosity conversations, and stepping away from work with wonder walks can spark unexpected insights.mind-wanderingFor anyone developing a signature book, a new keynote, or a game-changing idea, this means embracing moments of mental looseness before structuring and refining. It’s not about turning off strategy as much as it’s about knowing when to dial it down so creativity can breathe, so to speak.If creativity thrives when we release rigid control, how can we practice this daily? One way is with small, structured experiments that disrupt overthinking and invite unexpected insights. Call them Wonder Intervention Experiments (WIE).The goal of a WIEis to create a mindful, playful container that interrupts analysis paralysis and sparks creative intelligence. These micro-experiments take two forms: as adaily habitor as acreative disruption and joyful diversion.The goal of a WIEdaily habitcreative disruption and joyful diversionCreativity on Autopilot: How Practice Unlocks Your ArtWhat Do We Get Out of Art?One entrepreneurial business owner client had two competing parts of their business that weren't meshing in their brand storymarketing—and certainly not in their minds. In our kickoff jam, our conversation actually offered me a theme that held it all together. My client loved it. But that didn't mean their ideal hero-clients would, too.marketingSo she started experimenting. In how she showed up for clients and class members. In how she reframed her newsletter and offers. Just micro-experiments before going into a major, expensive rebranding.The results? She felt instantly more confident and excited because she had a lens through which to express her business's point of view. Her people felt more energized. People are responding to her newsletter and her new offers.My friend Jonathan Fields designed a series of experiments to help him reimagine the long arc of his life and contributions. One such experiment? Leaving the house earlier than usual to hike in the Rockies near his home.A client of mine rises an hour before her son and husband wake to play with clay and paint in her studio.A simple WIE framework:If I do[experimental activity]for[number of days],then[expected result].If I do[experimental activity]for[number of days]then[expected result].For example: “If I hike for an hour before 9 a.m. three times a week, then I will feel more energized in mind, body, and spirit—and be less prone to analysis paralysis.”I also create low-stakes creative activities to disrupt overthinking.One autumn, I launched an experiment calledBird Brain. A few times a week, I’d take my Canon camera outside, aiming to capture a bird in motion. I played with different settings, experimenting with contrast and composition. Some evenings, I’d pull up my best shot and sketch it with colored pencils.Bird BrainYes, I wanted to improve my photography and drawing skills. But my real aim? To quiet my overthinking mind and engage a different kind of intelligence.The results:weeks of feeling calmer, more focused, and making decisions with greaterconfidenceand clarity.The results:confidenceNow, my latest Wonder Intervention is calledObserve Growth. I take 20-minute drives through the mountains or walks through the woods, Canon in hand, looking for and photographing signs of growth. Sometimes I return to the same spot and track changes over time. Later, I review the photos and notice patterns.Observe GrowthWhat I’m noticing: I’ve primed myimaginationforgrowth—not just in nature, but in my clients, in Tracking Wonder’s business, in everything. The metaphors I glean from this practice are shaping how I strategize with clients on growing their businesses, visibility, and confidence.imaginationgrowthOthers are experimenting, too:What do these have in common? They stimulate the senses, engage the body, and expand awareness.EmbodimentandEngaging Your Environmentare two practices for an unbound mind—a mind free from its usual constraints, including the physicalboundariesof the brain.

Resisting Fake News: Does It Depend on Memory?
--- Data ---
Fake news, misinformation, disinformation, propaganda or just plain bunk is not new. Deliberatelyingor spreading of false information about one’s political rivals has a long and storied history. Some historians trace it back as far as Antony and Cleopatra, describing the attempts by Octavian to discredit his rival Antony by minting coins bearing descriptions of Antony as a womanizer and drunk, corrupted by Cleopatra (Fisher, 2023).Fake newslyingAs a means of smearing someone’s reputation, printing lies on coins seems clumsy and slow by today’s standards. Technological innovations like the printing press, the telephone, radio, television, computers, the internet and that yawning maw of misinformation,social media, have allowed for faster and wider dissemination of both real and false information seemingly to every corner of the world.social mediaSome misinformation is relatively harmless. For example, in 1835, a newspaper in New York printed a series of stories about life on the moon that started out plausible and then gradually got more fantastic with each new story. When a story appeared about humanoid creatures with gossamer wings inhabiting the moon, the number of voices claiming this to be a hoax grew too loud to ignore, and competing newspapers published articles dismissing the original article as a hoax. (Hall, 2014).But in other cases, disinformation can have serious consequences. Disinformation about vaccine efficacy and safety has made more people “vaccine hesitant”, which in turn puts friends, neighbors, schools, cities and entire populations at risk from diseases that can be avoided (Ruggeri, et al., 2024). And disinformation about human-caused global weather changes has endangered our entire planet (Treen, Williams and O’Neil, 2020).Social media has been described as an echo chamber, reflecting only what we already “know” and bouncing that information back at us. The insularity of these echo chambers and our frequent unwillingness to search for or expose ourselves to contrasting opinions drive polarization and make changing people’s minds (always hard to do) exponentially more difficult.In 2011, Cook and Lewandowski developed a “Debunking Handbook” which described three methods, based on studies of how humans think and form ideas, for debunking misinformation. Their intent was to avoid “backfire effects” where attempts to debunk can inadvertently reinforce the misinformation you’re trying to correct. The three methods they described are (1) focusing on the facts rather than the myth, (2) making sure that any mention of the myth was preceded by clear warning that the upcoming information is false, and (3) clearly providing an alternative explanation that explains where the original misinformation was inaccurate or skewed in its presentation.Their handbook was updated in 2020, incorporating more of the research that has been done on how to counter misinformation and debunk the bunk that is so pervasive (Lewandowski, et al., 2020). This research is ongoing in many cognitive psychology labs around the world. It has led to some interesting discoveries about why we are so prone to believe what we see or hear online or on television or wherever, and how we might go about changing that.Researchers Maertans, Roozenbeek, et al., (2025) examined the effectiveness of “inoculation” against false information. In the same way that inoculation with a vaccine will reduce susceptibility to a virus, three different types of psychological inoculation were tested. One group of participants read written presentation of the facts and the myth that scientists disagree onglobal warming. A second group received a “gamified” inoculation. They played a game called “The Bad News Game” that exposed them to the strategies (like the use of emotional language, and repetition of the myth) used to produce fake news. A third group watched videos that taught lessons about the use of emotionally manipulative language to get people to go along with fake news.global warmingEach group was split into three subgroups, the control (they played Tetris or a word sorting game), the inoculation group which received their cognitive inoculation (text, game or video) and a “booster” group which got another “dose” of the inoculation weeks later. Ultimately, each group was then exposed to the myth (a variety of myths were tested, not all about global warming). All participants were tested after exposure to the myth with a series of questions about what they believed (for example, what did they believe about consensus among scientists about global warming) to see if perception had changed, and questions about theirmemoryfor the inoculation material. Theoretically, inoculation should reduce belief in the myth, and the booster group should be the most resistant.memoryIs the "White Lotus" Monologue "Kinda Magical," or Orientalism?How Well Can People Spot Fake News?They found that all three methods of inoculation worked, which is helpful if you are interested in designing anti-misinformation programs. Resistance was directly tied to how well participants remembered the inoculation interventions. Better recall meant better resistance to the myth. And giving participants “booster” shots of the accurate information significantly extended both the duration and the strength of resistance.One important message in the research about changing minds about misinformation is that convincing people of the facts may not always translate into changing their behavior. A change in mindset, like any newly learned idea, can decay over time. That is why repeated debunking needs to happen, without stigmatizing people for believing the myths to begin with. Keep in mind thatshamingdoesn’t work — no one responds well to being told they are foolish. And, as in many things, persistence is key.shaming

When We Lean Too Heavily on Our Dogs
--- Data ---
For many of us, dogs are family members.Bernie, for example, occupies a space in my heart similar to one that would be reserved for a toddler. Each day, I escort him on potty breaks, make sure his belly is full, and monitor that he’s playing with safe toys.I’m continuallygratefulfor the lightness and joy he brings into our home. Bernie’s eager companionship, his happy expression, and the jaunty spring in his step make my dailypet parenting efforts worthwhile. At the same time, I work to give Bernie the same respect that children deserve and not ask him to carry me when I need to stand on my own two feet.gratefulpet parenting efforts worthwhileAs most of us know,parentingand family relationships—including those with pet dogs—sometimes get complicated.parentingincluding those with pet dogsIn the best scenario, parents serve as trustworthyattachmentfigures who prioritize the physical and psychological needs of family members. Together, parents and children behave as a cohesive family unit.attachmentSystems theory tells us that each family unit follows its own set of expectations and unspoken rules, maintaining its own delicate balance of interdependent roles and relationships. These roles and relationships create a tension and balance, with interpersonal dynamics that can be passed down generations.In a similar way, we develop afamily relationship with our pet dog. That relationship can be mutually comfortable and beneficial, or it can unintentionally slip into complex and potentially problematic family dynamics. For example, we may inadvertently come to rely too heavily on our pet for love, companionship,identity, or comfort.family relationship with our pet dogidentityOrdinarily, a small child depends on an older, stronger, and wiser adult for care, guidance, and protection. Sometimes, however, that parent is unavailable to fulfill those responsibilities, perhaps due tosubstance abuse, illness, or job obligations.substance abuseWhen that parent needs help of their own, a problem arises. With little other choice, their child will try to fill that void and care for the individual who should be their protector. This psychological dynamic is a role reversal called “parentification.” In this scenario, the immature child takes on the responsibility of caring for the parent. A child stuck in this situation is forced to grow up too soon and that burden and strain can lead to lifelong issues, such as chronicanxietyand difficulty trusting people.parentificationanxietyParallels can exist in our relationship with dogs. Although service dogs are indeed groomed and trained to become caregivers for people, there are many ordinarypetsthat find themselves cast in the role of emotional support animal, whether or not they are suited for it by breed and temperament. Their pet parent clings too tightly and becomes emotionally dependent on this pet to provide comfort, stability, andemotional regulation. This pet parent may inadvertently neglect potentially beneficial human relationships and instead continually touch, hug, stroke, or squeeze the dog to make themselves feel better. At the same time, they are ignoring or dismissing how uncomfortable and unhappy the dog is with constant smothering and handling.petsemotional regulationDogs who are parentified may also be subtly expected to make decisions that are not appropriate for a junior member of the family, such as how to greet strangers. This is similar to a child being cast in the role of protecting the family when instead an older, stronger, and wiser parent should take charge.Why Relationships MatterTake our Relationship Satisfaction TestFind a therapist to strengthen relationshipsNote that service animals whose job is emotional support should have been professionally evaluated, selected, and prepared, given time to mature appropriately, and sufficiently trained for their responsibilities. At the same time, their designated human should not rely exclusively on the dog, but instead have a broader network of support to address their spectrum of needs.Parents sometimes see themselves mirrored vividly in their child and forget that their child is actually an emotionally separate being. This is a psychological dynamic called enmeshment. Enmeshed love can become overbearing because the parent craves extreme closeness and involves themselves in every facet of the child’s life. In this emotional pattern,boundariesblur. The experience can feel suffocating and debilitating for a child, stunting their independence and increasing anxiety.boundariesWhen Sameness Betrays FairnessWhy Do We Hold on to Old Flames?There is a similar phenomenon when pet parents identify too closely with a dog, inadvertently micromanage their pet, and struggle to accept that their animal is an authentically separate individual being with its own thoughts,goals, and perspective. These pet parents may develop tunnel vision, seeing only what they expect to see regarding their dog. This is especially true if the pet parent is untrained in caninebody languagewhile at the same time has unmettraumaor overwhelming emotional needs of their own.goalsbody languagetraumaPet lovers with the most blurry emotional boundaries face a higher risk of becoming involved with pet rescue activities that deteriorate intopet hoardingsituations. Such kind-hearted individuals are not malicious, but their judgment gets clouded by an extremecaregivingcompulsion that may be driven bychildhoodtrauma, unresolved emotional attachment needs, and an attempt to soothe their own pain.pet hoardingcaregivingchildhoodPet parents with loving intentions are often unaware that an emotional dynamic has become unbalanced. One way to tell that a dog may be struggling with uncomfortable emotional dynamics is by looking for behaviors such as inability to settle, becoming withdrawn, hypervigilance, anxiety, clinginess, agitation, a tendency to over respond and over react to their environment, or evenaggression. No two dogs react precisely the same way; every response will reflect breed,genetics, learning background, and individual temperament.aggressiongeneticsAs I explain in my book,Tender Paws, recognizing a dog’s unmet needs often requires detective work. But restoring psychological balance and deepening our bond with a dog begins with a few simple steps. The first is to pause and take amindful, centering breath. Let our shoulders drop. Then we can reflect on when we feel loved and how we express love to others. We can reflect on our role in the family, meditate on our own emotional patterns and cravings, and consider how to meet everyone's needs compassionately.Tender PawsTender PawsmindfulAfter reflection, we can step up for our beloved dogs and see them more as they really are. We can offer gifts that are meaningful to our specific dog: they may crave more time to wander and explore, to sniff, to run, to chase, to relax, or to rest. We can let our dog choose when to be close to us and when to enjoypersonal space. The more we offer appropriate, safe opportunities to express their doggy self, the more we can delight in their joy.personal space

Why Aren't Kids More Independent?
--- Data ---
Kids aren’t doing things independently as much as they used to. This is the thesis of a recentpodcastby Screenagers founder Delany Ruston – and I highly suggest you listen.podcastHer first premise is that kids are less independent because they spend so much time watching screens. And her second premise is that kids are less independent because of parentalanxietyand the restrictions parents put on kids as a result.anxietyHer guest on the podcast is Lenore Skenazy, author ofFree Range Kids,the “terrible” mother who let her nine-year-old son ride the subway in New York City.Free Range Kids,Well, let me just say, I rode the public bus when I was nine – and I did it because I wanted to. I also went to spend overnights with my best friend – and from the time we were about six, her mother, who didn’t like to cook, would send us to the corner store for lunch.This was fun. This was exciting. And we didn’t get kidnapped.But these days, when we see kids riding the bus or the subway at nine or 10 and those who walk around alone or with a friend at six we think they are being neglected, possibly abused and definitely in danger.However, Dr. Ruston said an interesting thing. She quoted a mentor of hers as having said, “People do not mature in preparation for responsibility – they mature as a result of it.”And from my own personal experience, and as a child psychologist, I have found this to be true.My father died when I was 14. I started to be the one to lock the doors at night, just as he had once done. I mowed the lawn, as he had done, and when I was 15, I got a job.I didn’t do these things because my mother yelled at me and told me I had to. I did these things because I wanted to. Doing these things actually felt good. Doing these things made me feel more confident and more able. When I went away to college, I felt prepared to handle myself independently.Did my boss at work yell at me? Yes. Did she tell me I was terrible at my job? Yes. But I still enjoyed working for her, and Ireallyenjoyed getting that paycheck.reallyMeanwhile, in my practice, I am seeing college-aged kids who don’t seem to know how to do so many things, who seem self-critical, who seem to lackconfidenceand who seem to prefer to sit on their beds and scroll. I see college kids who need to text a parent multiple times a day. And I see college kids who, once they have an internship or a job, can’t stand a moment of criticism and feel like they have the right to push back immediately.confidenceI think these college kids are not used to being independent. I think they feel unsure of themselves and they need to check in with their parents to see if what they are doing or what they might do is OK. Often these are the kids who were driven everywhere they needed to go and who were given advice about everything they needed to do.Of course, their parents restricted their independence out offear. The kidnapper, the accident, the perpetrator lurked just around the corner. And their parents gave advice because they wanted the best for their kids. They hired the college consultant because they were unsure about whether their own judgment or their kids’ judgment about which colleges to apply to were good enough. They kept their kids from having jobs because they wanted them to get the best grades they could. They scheduled their kids with activities because this is what they thought was best for their kids.fearA Parent's RoleTake our Authoritative Parenting TestFind a family therapist near meBut does constant protection and constant advice give enough room for kids to experience life for themselves, to make some mistakes, to learn how to handle a yelling boss or a bus that never comes?I think we all know the answer.And for the ubiquitous phenomenon of overprotected kids, overanxious kids, and overanxious parents, I, like Dr. Ruston, blame screens. But for once, I don’t blame the screens the kids are on. I think part of the blame goes to the screens the parents are on.We know that we all receive too much news too much of the time via our phones. And we also know that we all receive an enormous amount of pseudo-news too much of the time. And we know that we keep reading this pseudo-news and we keep clicking on the clickbait even when we know we shouldn’t.For parents, the content they consume often has to do with all the worst things that can happen to kids, and all the possible criticisms of the parents whose children suffered these terrible things.Parenting7 Reasons Why "Bluey" Is a Masterclass in ParentingThe 5 Most Damaging Words to Say to a Struggling Adult ChildNo parent wants to be the bad parent. So, an abundance of caution, a fear of criticism, and genuine love for their children often keep parents from allowing their children a bit of freedom, a chance to take a walk or a bike ride with a friend, a trip on the bus or subway by themselves.And this spills into other decisions – do parents let their kids go on overnights or to overnight camp? Do they let them spend time with aged relatives? With relatives who are sick? Do they let their kids attend wakes or shivas or funerals?The worry parents experience can lead to restrictions on all sorts of experiences.Of course, the desire to protect comes from love. But we have to ask, what does our protection lead to in terms of kids’ development?My parents didn’t watch local news. In fact, they were busy and didn’t really watch TV at all. I’m sure they worried about my taking the bus. And yes, I later found out that my mother followed the bus on the first day and she followed me almost all the way home as I walked from the bus stop. But I didn’t know it. And I was so proud of myself for having successfully ridden the bus home! In fact, a few years later, on nice days I also started walking home from school. And it wasn’t a short walk. My older sister had done this before me and she could often be seen walking down the street while simultaneously reading a book. I wanted the same independence she had. I wanted to be like her. And even though I was six years younger than she was, my parents let me have it.Getting a hot dog with my friend at age six, riding the bus at age nine, losing my father at 14 – these experiences, and many more, both good and tragic, were all growth-promoting and independence-promoting experiences.

Is Suffering a Gift in Disguise?
--- Data ---
By Meredith J. Weinberg, MBA, and George S. Everly, Jr., PhDBy Meredith J. Weinberg, MBA, and George S. Everly, Jr., PhDSuffering often feels heavy, difficult, and even like a curse—something to be avoided at all costs. But in many of life’s challenges, frustrations, and disappointments, we have a choice: to see them as obstacles or as opportunities to wrestle with something and grow. In other words, what if suffering is both apunishmentand a privilege? The privilege to contend with something hard.punishmentLife often presents us with adversity so we may contend with something, wrestle with it, and in doing so, grow beyond who we were, becoming stronger beings who can carry more weight. Suffering can be an invitation—an opportunity to work within ourselves, to stretch beyond what comfort alone could ever teach us.Nobody wishes hardship on themselves or those they care about, yet growth rarely comes from ease. It is struggle that carves outwisdom, grit, andresilienceand creates a depth of character.wisdomresilienceHardship does not pause the world around us. Even in suffering, we must still wake up, eat, work, care for others, and manage our responsibilities. This duality—having to carry pain while also maintaining acts of daily living—pushes us to be more than we were. It teaches uscompartmentalization, even though the pain creeps in. It teaches us that we can function even when burdened. Over time, we learn that suffering and living coexist,and in that coexistence, we find our resilience.compartmentalization,What if we reframed hardship and tried to believe that the very act of contending with something—grappling with it, working through it, and ultimately coming to terms with it—is a gift. Pain, when met with courage and introspection, strips away the inessential. It forces us to confront who we are at our core and shapes us into who we are meant to become. It teaches patience, grit, faith, and inner strength.Many who suffer focus on the external—people, places, and things responsible for their situation. However, challenges are often not about the external situation and the characters and circumstances involved in them. It is about you versus you. The real work is in asking, “Despite this hardship, how will I give myself a bright spot today? How can I find a way to live with this circumstance?” Maturity is recognizing that both joy and suffering can coexist. You do not have to wait for the hardship to pass,and you can be proud of what you are accomplishing despite it. Accomplishments can be as simple as getting out of bed and facing the day.,When you fight through something difficult, you build self-respect. Every time you choose to endure, to show up despite discomfort, you reinforce your own capability. That confidence doesn’t come from ease; it comes from knowing you can withstand hardship. Suffering, then, is not just a test of endurance—it is a proving ground for your own strength.1. De-emphasize the Person, Place, or Circumstance1. De-emphasize the Person, Place, or CircumstanceIt’s easy to fixate on the specifics—who or what caused the hardship, or how things should have been different. We encourage you to stop analyzing the details and start working on the problem. It’s about you versus the challenge. Try to think of the bad actors in the situation simply as teachers and ultimately as lessons. What lesson have they come to teach you?What Is Resilience?Take our Resilience TestFind a therapist near me2. Recognize That Contending With Something Is the Gift Itself2. Recognize That Contending With Something Is the Gift ItselfThe struggle itself is where transformation happens. Wrestling with hardship—learning to sit with discomfort and work through it—ultimately leads to acceptance, change, or both.3. DevelopSelf-Confidenceby Facing Hardship Head-On3. DevelopSelf-Confidenceby Facing Hardship Head-OnSelf-ConfidenceEvery time you fight through something difficult, you build character and self-respect. Knowing that you can endure challenges gives you deep confidence and a sense of self. A helpful mantra might be that while you may bend, you will not break.This perspective is not meant to apply to all suffering, in all circumstances. Some pain is beyond reframing, and some hardships are beyond this framework. However, we encourage you to reframe your perspective as we believe it will allow you to better manage life’s inevitable disappointments.Ways Communities Can Support Youth Post-DisasterHow True Growth Transforms Your WorldThe notions presented here are not entirely new,but rather reformulated. Physiologically, a muscle grows stronger only if it has first been “injured.” Psychologically, inEcce Homo, Friedrich Nietzsche famously asserted:,Ecce Homo“What is it, fundamentally, that allows us to recognize who has turned out well? That which does not kill me makes me stronger. He instinctively gathers from everything he sees, hears, experiences…he discards much. He believes neither in ‘misfortune’ nor in ‘guilt’; he knows how to forget—he is strong enough; hence everything must turn out for his best.”guiltInCrimeand Punishment,Fyodor Dostoevsky examines the notion that those who are highly intelligent andempatheticwill experience deep pain:Crimeand Punishment,Crimeempathetic“Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a largeintelligenceand a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”“Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a largeintelligenceand a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”intelligenceHistorically, we are reminded of the Phoenix,which not only arose from its own ashes,but arose “more beautiful than before.” Consider that a mosaic composed of broken pieces can be just as beautiful as a piece of intact glass.,,In the final analysis, what happens to you occurs outside of you; how you react happens inside of you. That, you can work to control—it’s a practice—and from that, you can grow.© 2025. Meredith J. Weinberg, MBA, and George S. Everly, Jr., PhD

In recent years, psychedelics have stepped out of the shadows ofstigmaand into the spotlight as powerful catalysts for healing, self-discovery, and transformation. From psilocybin and MDMA to ayahuasca and LSD, these substances have shown immense potential for treating conditions likedepression,PTSD, andanxietywhile also offering profoundspiritualand creative insights.stigmadepressionPTSDanxietyspiritualYet, despite the growing enthusiasm around psychedelictherapy, one truth remains: there is no universal formula for a meaningful journey. What works for one person may not work for another. A deeply personal experience requires careful preparation,mindfulnavigation, and thoughtful integration afterward.therapymindfulA psychedelic journey should be as unique as the person taking it. Whether you're seeking emotional healing, spiritual awakening, or creative breakthroughs, tailoring the experience to your individual needs ensures that it is not only profound but also safe and meaningful.1.

That means your thoughts, emotions, and personal history shape the journey just as much as the substance itself.Someone working throughtraumamay experience deep emotional releases, while another person seeking spiritual insight may feel a sense of interconnectedness with the universe.

Common Reasons for Stopping Antipsychotics
--- Data ---
I know first-hand why people go off antipsychotics, and why it is hard to stay on them. I went off of them twice on my own and paid dearly for it. I know many others who go through similar issues, questioning whether they need to really be taking antipsychotics or not, and sometimesdecision-makingis influenced bystigmaor other fears surrounding antipsychotic use. I know that before I learned my lesson about staying on antipsychotics, I thought going off the antipsychotic symbolized:decision-makingstigmaIn other words, so much deep, profound meaning and power is placed on a bottle of pills. I have had two full-blown psychotic breaks due to going off my antipsychotic, and a motivating reason both times was the stigma of these drugs and a meaning and subjectivity I placed on using them.Medication adherence impacts others taking antipsychotics too. Patients who have experiencedpsychosishave trouble filling their prescriptions for antipsychotics, where they fill their prescriptions 40-60% of the days prescribed.[1]Non-adherence is the greatest predictor ofrelapsefor psychosis in seven long-term studies, increasing chance of relapse by 400%.[2]I explore additional thought processes here that can affect medicine adherence, based on firsthand experiences and discussions with participants of the support group I help facilitate.psychosis[1]relapse[2]Someone important in your life may say this to you. It seems that sometimes people say this to someone close to them as a well-meaning vote ofconfidence, as if by truly believing in someone, it means they could no longer have a serious mental illness or the potential for relapse.confidenceWith any other illness, no one would try to convince someone on a decision with potential critical health consequences other than a doctor, like if someone takes a medicine for a heart condition, cancer, blood pressure, or thyroid, because so much is on the line. While the opinions of loved ones who observe you on a daily basis do matter, your decision whether to stay or go off your medication should involve your doctor too. No one else is qualified by themselves to make that decision for you or convince you to do so.You can still be a good, strong, and reliable person who makes an excellent partner, family member, and friend while needing to take an antipsychotic long-term. It can mean a lot to have someone’s vote of confidence that you are well and healed, but people can still have full faith and confidence in you, even if you need to be on an antipsychotic.I think this statement is difficult because if you are doing well while on an antipsychotic, there is no way to know if it is the antipsychotic keeping you well or if it is because you no longer need an antipsychotic. To me, it makes sense to keep taking an antipsychotic in case it is the antipsychotic keeping me stable, because it is more important to me to be stable than to risk everything to prove that I don’t need to take the medicine. My primary objective is to never have a psychotic break again, where it doesn’t matter if I ever go off of an antipsychotic, as I’ve lost the sense of stigma attached to these drugs.What Is Psychopharmacology?Find a therapist near meTo me, taking an antipsychotic is a form of empowerment and a safety net that assures me I am less likely to have another psychotic break. The only thing that going off an antipsychotic would do for me would make me worry about if and when I could have another psychotic break. There’s a solid chance I wouldn’t have another break after all this time, but there’s no way of knowing for sure that I would not. Plus, I am on a second-generation antipsychotic, where this class of antipsychotics have been shown in research to help your brain heal and repair cognitively from a previous break through “multiple neuroprotective effects” and reducing “neurodegenerative effects” of psychosis.[3]So they don’t just stop another break from happening—they also help with cognitive repair from previous ones.[3]I think the ultimate goal should be to live well and be symptom-free instead of the ultimate goal to be completely off antipsychotics, as if that is more important than safeguarding your health.There is an enduring belief that antipsychotics cause more harm than good, based on the fact that there can be serious side effects involved, like weight gain and tardive dyskinesia, among others. Antipsychotic drugs may have undesirable side effects that impact quality of life, and I understand that as well as anyone. I’ve had more than one serious side effect, including oculogyric crises and weight gain I dealt with for 25 years, and occasionally tardive dyskinesia. I went off the drug twice because I couldn’t put up with the oculogyric crises anymore, where both times led to full-blown psychotic breaks. I would do anything to go back and have never gone off my medicine, even considering this side effect. Oculogyric crises “are a rare movement disorder characterized by paroxysmal, conjugate, tonic, usually upwards, deviation of the eyes.”[4][4]PsychopharmacologyThe Aftermath of Release From Mandatory Medication ComplianceIssues With Medication Compliance in Psychiatric DisordersWhile it would be ideal to take a medicine that prevents psychosis with less adverse side effects, we just don’t have that yet. Antipsychotics for most people are still the best solution that exists for now. I know that many people worry about damage caused by side effects through long-term antipsychotic use, but according to a 2018 study, “mortality and neuropathological findings do not support an accrual of damage from cumulative antipsychotic dose and duration (with the exception of tardive dyskinesia).”[5][5]Side effects are unfortunate and feel so unfair at times, but it is what it is. We put up with side effects because it prevents something even worse from happening. At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself what’s worse – your side effect or another psychotic break. I dealt with my oculogyric crises for another 12 years until my psychiatrist and I finally found an antipsychotic that doesn’t cause them. Putting up with my side effect for another 12 years, while unfortunate, meant I’ve never had a psychotic break again for 13 years and counting, where I could rebuild my life in the meantime. And now we’ve found an antipsychotic that doesn’t cause that side effect, but it took patience and time.So yes, there are tempting reasons to go off antipsychotics that I’ve chosen myself, but in my own experience and those similar experiences of others in my support group, there can be important reasons to stay on antipsychotics, where you shouldn’t necessarily let stigma orfearof the drugs themselves prevent you from achieving your optimal long-term wellbeing.fear

Memories of Suicide Can Last Forever
--- Data ---
I didn't know Mike well. No one did. He was the kind of person you saw once or twice a year, were reminded how intense and intellectually curious he was, told yourself that you should see him more often, but somehow never got around to it.Women fell in love with him on sight. He had jet-black hair and movie-star looks, but that was only half of it. There was a hint of danger in him, of someone who trusted his instincts completely, without thought that they could be wrong.Men like me envied his knowledge of machines. Mike was a mechanic at a major airline. He could take apart any kind of engine and put it together again. He could also build anything from scrap. Need a compressor to paint your house? “Here,” he'd say. “Let me pull the motor off this old lawn mower, weld a stand for it, and mount some wheels. It'll just take a minute.”Despite having seniority, Mike worked weekends and holidays at the airline because it didn't matter to him; he didn't have a family. He rarely traveled, even though he could fly for free anywhere in the world, because there was no place he wanted to see. He never bought a house, although he could easily have afforded one. He did buy a junkyard, though, a real junkyard so that he had plenty of material for his building projects.About 10 years into hiscareerat the airlines, Mike fell from the wing of a 747. He hit the tarmac and shattered both legs. Doctors inserted pins to hold his bones together but said he'd probably never walk again. Mike didn't hear them. He built a customized wheelchair to propel himself around his shop and then invented a series of walkers and pushed himself maniacally to become more mobile. In eight months, he was fully recovered; years later, doctors still wrote about him in medical journals withawe.careeraweLong after his accident, Mike learned that I liked to play tennis. He challenged me to a match even though he couldn’t remember the last time he’d played. When he showed up, he was dressed the way he always was, entirely in black—a black T-shirt, black jeans, and black, rubber-soled shoes. Those were the only clothes I ever saw him wear, except when it was cold and he added a black leather jacket. The racket he played with was retrieved from a dumpster.After we rallied for a few minutes, Mike insisted that we play a set. As soon as we started, he tried to hit a winner on every shot. Usually he failed, although a few times—almost by force of will—he surprised me.“Relax, Mike,” I said at one point. “Have some fun. We don’t need to keep score.”“It’s only fun if you do something you don’t think you can do,” he said.A lifelong smoker, Mike developed lung cancer in his 40s. He didn't tell anyone or seek treatment of any kind. Early one morning, before his health began to deteriorate, he drove his pickup truck to a park, strapped a rifle to the door frame, and shot himself in the head while sitting in the driver's seat. There was nosuicidenote. Only later, when going through his effects and finding X-rays, did friends learn about his illness. Meanwhile, police marveled at the gun's construction. In typical fashion, Mike made it himself.suicideSuicide Risk Factors and SignsTake our Depression TestFind a therapist near meAll of this happened years ago. I still think about it, though.

As a mother, I know all too well theguiltandshamethat come with watching your child make a mistake or behave in a way they shouldn't. But I also know the pride and joy that fill your heart when your child achieves a goal or shows kindness to others. Why do we, as mothers, become so deeply entwined with our children's actions that we take their behavior as a direct reflection of our own success or failure?guiltshameThis tendency is nothing new. For generations, when a child struggled, or an adult faltered, people instinctively turned their judgmental gaze toward the mother. If a child misbehaves at school, the assumption is that the mother isn't strict enough. If an adult struggles in relationships, there are whispers questioning whether their mother is emotionally available. Yet this narrow focus not only oversimplifies the intricate process of human development but also ignores the countless other influences shaping a person's life.Child developmentis never the sole responsibility of a single person, not even the mother, as vital as her role may be. It's a dynamic process shaped by various factors, including fathers, extended family, societal norms, schools, genetics, peer groups, and so much more. By solely blaming mothers, society not only places an unfair and exhausting burden on them but also overlooks opportunities to address the deeper, multifaceted nature of what it takes to raise healthy, well-adjusted children. When we condemn mothers, we risk triggering a cycle of shame and reactivity, which can lead to less effectiveparentingin moments when understanding and patience are needed most.Child developmentparentingIt's undeniable that feeling pride in our children's accomplishments can be exhilarating—but that joy can be fleeting the moment they make a mistake. This tight emotional bond can blind mothers to an important truth: children will make mistakes because they are still learning. They aren't perfect; they are simply navigating the world with fresh eyes and a brain that's still developing, just as we once did. Recognizing this doesn't diminish a mother's role but frees her to parent from a place ofconfidencerather thanfearwhile acknowledging that her child's growth is influenced by much more than just her.confidencefearBefore we move beyond this blame, it's important to acknowledge the role of mothers in child development. Research underscores that mothers often act as primary caregivers, especially in early childhood, laying the groundwork for emotionalattachmentand security. Their love, presence, and ability to regulate their child's world can significantly influence their well-being during formative years. However, the expectation that mothers should bear sole responsibility for all outcomes is unrealistic and unsupported by behavioral science.attachmentMothers cannot exist in a vacuum. Their parenting is deeply intertwined with resources, cultural expectations, and the physical and emotional support they receive (or lack thereof) from partners, family members, and the community. This interconnectedness is where Bowen family systems theory, a key framework intherapy, offers valuable insights.therapyBowen's family systems theory proposes that each family functions as an interconnected emotional unit, akin to parts of an intricate machine. No single member operates independently of the others. When a child struggles, asking, "What's wrong with mom?" misses the bigger picture of how the entirefamily dynamicmay be contributing.family dynamicUnderstanding Child DevelopmentTake our Authoritative Parenting TestFind a child or adolescent therapist near meFor instance, research shows that fathers play a crucial role in children's emotional and cognitive development. Warm, engaged fathering has been linked to betterself-esteem, academic success, and reduced behavioral problems in children. Extended families, such as grandparents, often pass down values, model coping strategies, and offer additional layers of support orstress. Ignoring such factors reduces complex systems into a one-dimensional narrative.self-esteemstressOutside the immediate family, society and environmental context weigh heavily on a child's development. Peers shape social behavior, schools influence both educational outcomes andself-concept, and culture imposes norms on how emotions and behavior are expressed. Meanwhile, advances inbehavioral geneticsresearch have shown that certain traits and predispositions—such as temperament or vulnerability toanxiety—are often influenced by both DNA and environmental triggers. To attribute every difficulty a person faces to their mother diminishes these critical pieces of the puzzle.self-conceptbehavioral geneticsanxietyHow to Raise Kids Who Don't Give UpIs "Paying Attention" Overrated for Kids?Placing the blame solely on mothers often distorts our understanding of the problem itself. For instance, assigning responsibility to a mother for ateenager's rebellious behavior might ignore a neglectful father figure,bullyingpeers, or mental health struggles. It unfairly isolates the mother and traps her in a spiral of guilt and shame, impairing her ability to parent effectively.teenagerbullyingThis misplaced focus also leads to inaction in other areas. When fathers, schools, communities, or governments are left out of the conversation, they are absolved of their responsibility to contribute to nurturing and protecting children's well-being. This creates systemic blind spots and hinders a holistic approach to supporting families.Shifting the narrative doesn't mean downplaying the influence of mothers; rather, it means rebalancing the scales. Raising children is a shared responsibility across many relationships and societal factors. Fathers must step up to engage more meaningfully in both day-to-day parenting and emotionalcaretaking. Communities must create systems of support for families, ensuring childcare resources and mental health services are accessible to all. Schools must provide environments where children feel secure and supported.caretakingMost importantly, families must work as cohesive units, addressing dysfunction collaboratively rather than scapegoating one member. Therapy can be instrumental in helping families identify and address unhealthy patterns that could be subtly (and often unintentionally) influencing a child's behavior.When we stop blaming mothers and start examining the full complexity of child development, we open the door to deeper understanding and meaningful growth—not just for children but also for families and society as a whole. The way forward lies not in placing undue weight on a single individual but in spreading the responsibility across all the factors that shape a person.No one raises a child alone, and no one should be held accountable as if they do. Families, communities, and societies thrive when we work together to nurture the next generation. It's time to leave the blame behind and focus on what truly matters: raising the next generation of emotionally healthy individuals.If you're interested in exploring how family dynamics or external factors might influence your children's behavior and would like support in creating meaningful changes, consider contacting amarriageand family therapist.

Precognitive Dreams: When Your Dreams Come True
--- Data ---
Dreamwork is a multifaceted process requiring a basicunderstanding of symbolsand a healthy dose of humility. There are some things we can decipher and some that will remain mysterious. However, what can help you traverse the often enigmatic terrain ofdreamsis knowing five ways to understand the language of dreams:understanding of symbolsdreamstraumaticAs a depth-orientedpsychoanalystand someone who specializes in dreamwork, I find all dream categories fascinating, but extrasensory, precognitive dreams most often enthrall the general public. Some people dismiss these dreams out of hand, saying it’s not possible to predict the future. This is a common response, and we can all easily fall into the unconscious practice of holding strong opinions toward that which we have neither experienced nor understood. Jung spoke to this when he said, “Never do human beings speculate more, or have more opinions, than about things which they do not understand.”psychoanalystIf we dig a little deeper, however, we often learn the limitations of solely relying on sources of knowledge that privilege evidence, certitude, precision, and quantifiable phenomena because some things defy logic. For instance, in one of my courses on dreamwork at Notre Dame de Namur University, a graduate student, who was skeptical about these ideas, revealed a dream he had about me. He said in the dream he was looking for me and two women, Barbara and Mimi, described as my close friend and next-door neighbor, who were guiding him to me. My close friend really is Barbara, and my next-door neighbor really is Mimi. My student didn’t have any knowledge of these relationships, nor the names of these two women.He also revealed additional details in his dream that paralleled an atypical experience with Barbara I had that week. He conveyed Barbara’s and Mimi’s physical appearance, our lives, and relationships. Some people might call his dream a coincidence and brush it aside, but that does a disservice to the psyche. Moreover, brushing it aside forecloses what we can learn from this dream. The unexplained lives side by side with the rational, known, predictable, and proven. Furthermore, the validity of precognitive dreams has been demonstrated.As referenced in aGood Housekeepingarticle, Suzanne Degregorio had a recurring dream where she heard over and over again, “It's your time to get cancer.” Her most recent mammogram showed no signs of breast cancer, and she didn’t have a family history of the disease. Her radiologist mentioned she had dense breasts, which makes breast cancer harder to detect, so she pushed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in tandem with a mammogram at her next screening.Good HousekeepingSure enough, the MRI revealed a suspicious lesion and a biopsy confirmed Degregorio had breast cancer. Her experience isn’t so out of the ordinary—a 2015 study in the scientific journalExploredemonstrated more than half of the study participants reported they had warning dreams about breast cancer.1Again, they had no family or personal history of the disease, and, in 94 percent of cases, the dreams were the first clue the women had cancer.ExploreThere aren’t many recent statistics on precognitive dreams, but a study from 2009 found that as many as 60 percent of people have experienced precognitive dreams.2Why, or how, are people capable of precognitive dreams? No one knows for sure, but the mind is capable of deep revelations during REM. As I mentioned, dreams have their own language; they communicate in symbols and are insulated from the external influences of the waking world. That means the rational mind is less capable of interjecting and saying, “No, that can’t happen,” and, thus, “irrational” information is more easily communicated and accepted.This is possible because the unconscious andsubconsciousmind are constantly taking in information that the conscious mind does not perceive, and these ideas, experiences, and research findings further confirm that this is true. The information the mind takes in includes subtle clues or patterns we’ve noticed but not registered. In dreamland, these clues and patterns rise to the surface so that the hidden knowledge is no longer hidden. That can explain why people are able to predict their own medical diagnoses before a doctor does, but it doesn’t explain other precognitive dreams, ones that don’t involve the person at all, and instead predict future events. We’ll discuss those sorts of precognitive dreams in my next post.subconscious

What Causes Depression? New Research Confirms Ancient Wisdom
--- Data ---
Imagine waking up feelinganxiousand hopeless. You think “I’ll never be happy. Nothing I do matters.” The more you dwell on these thoughts, the worse you feel. But what’s really going on? Are your thoughts causing your feelings, or is it the other way around?anxiousFor centuries, people have debated the cause of emotional suffering. Is itchildhoodtrauma? A chemical imbalance in the brain? A lack of love and connection? Every school of psychology has its own theory—the list goes on, with hundreds of theories but little conclusive proof.childhoodtraumaOver 1,700 years ago, the ancient Greek Stoic philosopher, Epictetus, proposed an entirely different theory. He argued that it’s not life events that upset us, but our thoughts about them. This controversial idea became the foundation ofcognitive behavioraltherapy(CBT), developed by Drs. Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck. CBT suggests that if you change the way you think, you can change the way you feel.cognitive behavioraltherapyIt’s a bold and exciting claim—but is it true? With data from a new mental health app, we set out to join the debate.In our first study, we analyzed data from 290 beta testers of the Feeling Great app. Unlike traditional studies that rely on broad, retrospective surveys (asking how you’ve felt over the past two weeks), our app measured users’ negative thoughts and feelings in the here and now, using new, extremely sensitive scales.This distinction is crucial. By tracking moment-to-moment changes, we could test whether beliefs in negative thoughts (e.g., I’m a failure) actually cause negative feelings—or whether it’s the other way around.Here’s the data on first-time users who successfully reduced their belief in a single distressing negative thought to zero. On average, one-third of the users achieved this goal in just 80 minutes. The impact on negative feelings was remarkable.As you can see in Figure 1, users who reduced their belief in their negative thought to zero experienced an average 87 percent reduction in seven negative emotions during their first session with the app.But does this result prove that negative thoughts cause negative feelings? No, because it could just as easily be the other way around. Maybe the app changed negative feelings, which then caused the dramatic reduction in negative thoughts.Can this riddle be solved? Using advanced statistical modeling, we tested four possibilities:What Is Depression?Take our Depression TestFind a therapist to overcome depressionIn short, our data strongly supports the central premise of CBT—that thoughts shape emotions far more than emotions shape thoughts. If true, this has profound implications for how we approach mental health treatment.A highly acclaimed2015 studypublished inSciencefound that over 50 percent of behavioral science studies fail to replicate. This means that even the most promising results often collapse under scrutiny.2015 studyScienceTo ensure that our findings were solid, we conducted a second independent study with 1,393 users of anAI-enhanced version of the app. The results? Practically identical.AIInterestingly, with the larger sample size, we did detect a small but statistically significant effect of emotions influencing thoughts—but the effect was barely detectable and far weaker than the impact of thoughts on feelings. This suggests that emotions can sometimes influence thoughts, but the effect is minor in comparison to the power of thoughts to shape emotions.DepressionRoughly Half of Depression Diagnoses Are Treatment-ResistantHow We Can Miss One of the Easiest Ways to Feel GoodSo, was Epictetus right? It seems so.Earlier we showed the dramatic changes in negative feelings in users who crushed their negative thought the first time they used the app. But how about those who didn’t completely reduce their belief in their negative thought to zero? As you can see in Figure 2, the degree of emotional improvement in all users correlated precisely with the amount by which their belief in the thought decreased.The reduction in users’ beliefs in negative thoughts was strongly correlated with reductions in all seven negative emotions. This strongly suggests that reducing belief in distorted negative thoughts may be one of the fastest and most effective methods for relieving not only depression but a wide variety of negative feelings.These findings open exciting new doors for mental health treatment. The data also suggest that many may be able to modify negative feelings rapidly, affordably, and without any human interventions. The rapid changes we observed suggest that many people can find relief from feelings of hopelessness and despair in hours, or days, without years of therapy.The data is promising, but we also recognize that human connection and support will always remain essential. For many, face-to-face therapy will continue to be life-changing—and, in some cases, life-saving.But we have scientific proof that changing how you think really can change how you feel—and that this transformation is possible using an automated digital device.And that’s a discovery Epictetus would have been proud of.And how aboutFreud? He might not be quite as happy.Freud

March Madness Masks a Hidden Epidemic
--- Data ---
March Madness comes with an explosion of sports betting. Since the Supreme Court lifted the federal gambling ban in 2018, 38 states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports betting, making it easier than ever to place a wager—it's just a few taps on a phone.Unlike traditional gambling, where bets were placed before a game started, today’s online platforms encourage real-time, play-by-play betting, keeping users engaged (and spending) throughout an entire event. According to the American Gambling Association, Americans legally bet more than $115 billion last year, with $1.39 billion wagered on the Super Bowl alone. Meanwhile, online gambling companies spent over $400 million onadvertising, aggressively targeting young people, particularly young men.advertisingWith nonstop media coverage, friendly office betting pools, and high-adrenalinecompetition, the perfect storm for problem gambling is forming.

What’s Wrong With How We See Epilepsy?
--- Data ---
Purple Day, observed annually on March 26, raises epilepsy awareness and dispels myths. Despite affecting 50 million people worldwide (WHO, 2022), epilepsy remains misunderstood, leading to stigma and treatment barriers. This article explores persistent myths and media-driven misconceptions.Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting 1 in 100 people (Epilepsy Action UK, 2023). In the United States, 3.4 million people live with epilepsy (Epilepsy Foundation of America, 2023). Many cases go undiagnosed, reinforcing misconceptions about its prevalence.While generalized seizures cause convulsions, epilepsy includes other types like absence seizures (brief awareness lapses), atonic seizures (muscle weakness), and focal seizures (sensory disturbances; Epilepsy Society, 2023). Many seizures are subtle and go unnoticed.In some cultures, epilepsy is still linked to demonic possession or witchcraft. Historically, this misconception led tofearand isolation (Temkin, 1994). Even today, stigma prevents medical care, with some relying on harmful traditional practices (Epilepsy Action UK, 2023).fearEpilepsy itself doesn’t cause cognitive impairment (Camfield & Camfield, 2015). Many successful individuals, including Sir Isaac Newton and Vincent van Gogh, had epilepsy (Hughes, 2005), proving thatintelligenceis not affected.intelligenceRestraining someone during a seizure or placing objects in their mouth can cause injury. Instead, bystanders should ensure safety by clearing sharp objects, positioning the person on their side, and allowing the seizure to pass (Epilepsy Foundation of America, 2023).Driving regulations for people with epilepsy vary significantly across the world, but the belief that individuals with epilepsy can never drive is not entirely accurate. In countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, people with epilepsy can obtain a driver’s license if they have been seizure-free for a certain period, typically one to two years, depending on their specific condition and local regulations (Epilepsy Society, 2023). However, in countries such as India and China, the laws are far stricter—anyone who has ever had a seizure, regardless of seizure control, is permanently banned from obtaining a driver’s license (Gupta, 2017). These rigid policies limit independence for people with well-managed epilepsy. Advocacy groups like Epilepsy Action UK and the Epilepsy Foundation of America continue to push for fairer, evidence-based regulations.Media plays a significant role in shaping public perceptions of epilepsy, yet portrayals often reinforce harmful stereotypes instead of providing accurate information. Films frequently exaggerate seizures for dramatic effect, depicting uncontrollable convulsions or unrealistic medical interventions, which mislead audiences about the true nature of epilepsy (Duncan, 2022). Additionally, the misconception that all individuals with epilepsy are photosensitive persists, despite only about 3 percent of cases involving photosensitivity (Fisher et al., 2005). Fictional characters with epilepsy have historically been portrayed as unstable, dangerous, or even possessed, further perpetuating stigma and negatively impacting employment opportunities andself-esteem(Schachter, 2021; Epilepsy Society, 2023). To challenge these misconceptions, it is crucial to foster awareness througheducation, advocacy, and responsible media representation. However, epilepsy awareness efforts often lack representation from diverse ethnic backgrounds, making inclusion essential for a more equitable approach to advocacy and public understanding.self-esteemeducationOrganizations such as Epilepsy Action UK, Epilepsy Society, and the Epilepsy Foundation of America play a crucial role in providing resources and advocating for better healthcare policies. Their initiatives help individuals with epilepsy challenge societal stigma. However, greater efforts are needed to amplify voices from minority communities, who often face additional barriers such as cultural stigma and healthcare inequities.Personal stories are powerful tools for challenging stereotypes. Yet, epilepsy narratives predominantly reflect Western perspectives, leaving gaps in representation for people from minority backgrounds. Platforms are needed to share diverse experiences, highlighting how cultural beliefs and socioeconomic factors shape epilepsy journeys.Mental Health StigmaHow Do People with Facial Differences Feel About Wearing Masks?Ableism Is a Major Barrier to Mental HealthcareLegal protections, improved healthcare access, and antidiscrimination policies are crucial advocacygoals. These efforts must also address the unique struggles faced by minority groups, including cultural stigma and financial constraints. Increased funding for research on epilepsy in diverse populations and targeted awareness campaigns can help bridge these gaps.goalsEpilepsy remains one of the most misunderstood neurological conditions, often misrepresented and marginalized. To create a future where epilepsy awareness is inclusive, diverse voices must be heard, and stigma actively dismantled. True progress can only be achieved when advocacy efforts reflect the realities of all people affected by epilepsy.
